## Overview
This repository provides examples and templates for designing agentic workflows, which are workflows composed of self-contained agents, each responsible for distinct tasks. The focus is on creating reusable components that can be adapted for various automation tasks, enabling intelligent decision-making and streamlined processing.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to get started. This project requires Python 3.8 or later.

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `pip` (comes with Python 3.8+)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Agentic-Workflow-Patterns.git
   cd Agentic-Workflow-Patterns
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .agentic-workflow-patterns
   source .agentic-workflow-patterns/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Upgrade pip and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Setup
To maintain a clean environment and disable Python bytecode generation, configure the following environment variables:

```bash
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
```

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can start experimenting with the workflow patterns included in this repository. Each pattern is documented with examples and explanations to demonstrate its use in building agentic workflows.
