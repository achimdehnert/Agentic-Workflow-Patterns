# Pattern 7 - Dynamic Decomposition

## Overview

The Dynamic Decomposition is an advanced design pattern where a Coordinator Agent autonomously decomposes a complex task into multiple subtasks without predefined structures. The coordinator uses an LLM to generate subtasks, which are then processed by separate Sub-Task Agents in parallel. After all subtasks are completed, the coordinator gathers and combines the results to produce a structured summary.
This is a natural variant of the previous pattern 6 task decomposition what we covered where the subtasks were handed to the coordinator agent by human user. This is an effective pattern when the given task in hand is not clearly defined out (can be strictly broken into a list of subtasks in the right order).
Let's say we don't have this information in hand or maybe the number of subtasks and the order of execution is long - we can let the coordinator handle this and spawn and delegate subtasks accordingly. This also ties back to the previous article on designing a ReAct agent from scratch where we saw how to design agents that can handle breaking a main task into subtasks and execute them successfully.

## Key Components

### **CoordinatorAgent**
- **Receives the complex task input**.
- **Analyzes the task** using an LLM to dynamically determine necessary subtasks.
- **Decomposes the task** into independent subtasks.
- **Spawns sub-agents** for each identified subtask.
- **Waits** until all sub-agents complete their assigned tasks.
- **Combines results** from all sub-agents into a structured summary.

### **SubTaskAgent**
- **Receives** a specific subtask from the coordinator.
- **Processes** the subtask by interacting with an LLM.
- **Extracts information** or performs analysis based on the assigned task.
- **Returns the result** to the coordinator.

### **ResponseGenerator**
- Interfaces with the LLM to generate subtasks and process individual subtasks.

### **Message**
- Represents messages exchanged between agents, containing content, sender, and recipient information.

## Process Flow

1. The coordinator receives the complex task input.
2. It uses an LLM to generate subtasks for analyzing or processing the input.
3. The LLM output is parsed from JSON format into a dictionary of subtasks.
4. Sub-agents are created for each subtask:
   a. Each sub-agent receives a message with the task details.
   b. The sub-agent prepares an input for the LLM based on its specific task.
   c. The LLM is called to process the task or extract information.
   d. The result is returned to the coordinator.
5. All sub-agents execute their tasks in parallel.
6. The coordinator collects results from all sub-agents.
7. A final structured summary is created, combining all subtask results.
