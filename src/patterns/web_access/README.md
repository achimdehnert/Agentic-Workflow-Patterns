# Pattern 2 - Web Access 

## Overview

The **Web Access** pattern implements an agentic workflow for retrieving, processing, and summarizing web content. This pattern establishes a serial pipeline where scrape depends on the output of search and summarize depends on the output of scrape. The pattern orchestrates three specialized agents (one per step) that handle different aspects of web content acquisition and processing through search, scrape, and summarize operations, passing the query along for every step. It leverages Gemini Flash with Function Calling for search, and Gemini is also used to clean up the scraped HTML content from the scraped webpages and finally to coalesce a summary - so used at all 3 steps. The pattern leverages the SERP API for web searches and language models for generating queries and summaries. You can change model to any model of your choice - Gemini Pro 1.5 and Flash are supported with the modules currently.

## Key Components

### WebSearchAgent
- Orchestrates search operations using language models
- Generates optimized search queries from user input
- Interfaces with SERP API for web searches
- Saves structured search results for further processing

### WebScrapeAgent
- Handles concurrent content extraction from search results
- Implements rate-limited scraping to respect server limits
- Processes and cleans extracted content
- Saves structured content for summarization

### WebContentSummarizeAgent
- Processes scraped content using language models
- Generates concise content summaries
- Uses templated prompts for consistent output
- Produces final summarized results

### Pipeline
- Coordinates execution of all agents
- Manages data flow between components
- Handles cleanup and error recovery
- Provides simple interface for workflow execution

## Process Flow

1. **Search Phase**
   - User query is received by the pipeline
   - WebSearchAgent generates optimized search instructions
   - SERP API returns search results
   - Results are saved for scraping

2. **Scrape Phase**
   - WebScrapeAgent loads search results
   - Content is extracted from web pages concurrently
   - Extracted content is cleaned and processed
   - Structured content is saved for summarization

3. **Summarize Phase**
   - WebContentSummarizeAgent loads scraped content
   - Language model generates content summary
   - Final summary is saved and returned
   - Pipeline completes execution

Effectively, this pattern shows tool use by agents - later other patterns can leverage this pipeline for web access. The entire process can be executed with a single function call:
```python
from src.patterns.web_access.pipeline import run

# Executes the complete pipeline: search -> scrape -> summarize
summary = run("search query", model_name="gemini-1.5-flash-001")
```
