# Will Smith: Actor, Rapper, and Producer

Will Smith is a successful American actor, rapper, and film producer who rose to fame in the 1990s. He began his career as a rapper with DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, releasing five studio albums and winning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989.  

Smith's acting career began with the sitcom *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* (1990-1996), which was loosely based on his own life. The show's success led to his transition to film, where he achieved major box office success with films like *Bad Boys* (1995), *Independence Day* (1996), and *Men in Black* (1997). He also pursued his solo music career, releasing four albums, including *Big Willie Style* (1997) and *Willennium* (1999), and winning two Grammy Awards for Best Rap Solo Performance.

Smith has earned critical acclaim for his dramatic roles, including his portrayal of Muhammad Ali in *Ali* (2001), which earned him an Academy Award nomination, and his performance in *The Pursuit of Happyness* (2006), which earned him a second Oscar nomination. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Richard Williams in the biographical sports drama *King Richard* (2021).

Smith's success has extended beyond acting and music. He has produced several films, including some in which he starred. He and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, also helped create and produce the sitcom *All of Us* (2003-2007). 

Smith's career has been marked by controversy, particularly after an incident at the 2022 Academy Awards, where he slapped comedian Chris Rock after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife. This incident led to Smith resigning from the Academy and being banned from attending all Academy events for ten years.  

Despite the controversy, Smith remains one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, known for his charisma, versatility, and ability to connect with audiences.
