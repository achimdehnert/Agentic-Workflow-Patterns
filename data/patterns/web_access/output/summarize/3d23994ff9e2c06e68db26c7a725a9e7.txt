# Robert Downey Jr.: A Life in Film, From Early Success to Superhero Stardom

Robert Downey Jr., born April 4, 1965, is an American actor known for both his dramatic and comedic roles, as well as his well-documented struggles with substance abuse.  His films have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Downey's career has been marked by early success, a period of drug-related difficulties, and a resurgence in popularity and commercial success since the late 2000s.

Downey's acting debut came at age five in his father's 1970 film "Pound." He rose to prominence in the 1980s, appearing in films like "Weird Science" (1985) and "Less Than Zero" (1987). His portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic "Chaplin" earned him a BAFTA Award and his first Academy Award nomination. 

However, Downey's struggles with addiction began in his childhood and continued into adulthood.  He experienced numerous arrests related to drugs and alcohol, ultimately serving time in prison. 

Following years of rehabilitation and recovery, Downey returned to acting in the early 2000s, beginning with the 2003 film "The Singing Detective." His career rebounded with roles in "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" (2005), "Zodiac" (2007), and "Tropic Thunder" (2008), for which he received another Academy Award nomination. 

Downey achieved global recognition for starring as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with the 2008 film "Iron Man." His portrayal of the character helped launch the MCU franchise and established Downey as a box office draw.  

In addition to his work in the MCU, Downey also starred in the Sherlock Holmes films (2009, 2011), which earned him his second Golden Globe Award. 

He continued to diversify his roles, taking on dramatic parts in films like "The Judge" (2014) and "Oppenheimer" (2023), winning an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the latter. 

In 2024, Downey made his Broadway debut in "McNeal" and was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his performance in the HBO miniseries "The Sympathizer."  

In July 2024, it was announced that Downey will return to the MCU in a new role as Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom in the upcoming films "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" (2025), "Avengers: Doomsday" (2026), and "Avengers: Secret Wars" (2027).

Downey has maintained his sobriety since 2003, attributing his recovery to support from his family, therapy, meditation, and twelve-step programs.  He has also been an advocate for criminal justice reform, serving on the board of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition.
