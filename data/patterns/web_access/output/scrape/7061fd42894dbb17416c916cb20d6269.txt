He is the recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. One of the most influential celebrities, Pitt appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list from 2006 to 2008, and the Time 100 list in 2007. Pitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the Ridley Scott road film Thelma & Louise (1991). Pitt emerged as a star taking on leading man roles in films such as the drama A River Runs Through It (1992), the western Legends of the Fall (1994), the horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994), and the crime thriller Seven (1995). Pitt found greater commercial success starring in Steven Soderbergh's heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001), and reprised his role in its sequels. He cemented his leading man status starring in blockbusters such as the historical epic Troy (2004), the romantic crime film Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), the horror film World War Z (2013), and the action film Bullet Train (2022). Pitt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing a stuntman in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). He was Oscar-nominated for his roles in the science fiction drama 12 Monkeys (1995), the fantasy romance The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and the sports drama Moneyball (2011). He also starred in acclaimed films such as Fight Club (1999), Babel (2006), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), Burn After Reading (2008), Inglourious Basterds (2009), The Tree of Life (2011), and The Big Short (2015). In 2001, Pitt co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment.[3] As a producer he won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 12 Years a Slave (2013) and was nominated for Moneyball (2011) and The Big Short (2015). Pitt was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1995 and 2000. Early life William Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor.[4] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Pitt (b. 1966) and Julie (née Pitt) Neal (b. 1969).[5] Born into a conservative Christian household,[6][7] he was raised as Southern Baptist and later "oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism."[8] He later reconciled his belief in spirituality.[9] Pitt has described Springfield as "Mark Twain country, Jesse James country," having grown up with "a lot of hills, a lot of lakes."[10] Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming, and tennis teams.[11] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[12] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[13] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—"a portal into different worlds for me"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[14][15] Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[14] He has named Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as his early acting heroes.[16] Career Early work (1987–1993) While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[12][17] His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less than Zero (1987).[12][18] In May 1987, he made his television debut in a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[19] In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom Trial and Error[20][21] and the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[22] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall).[23] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[24] In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) was his first leading film role, starring as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[12] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[22] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[25] Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary."[26] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image.[27] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.[28] The same year he featured in a Levi's jeans TV commercial based around the song "20th Century Boy" which played in the background.[29] After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[27] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[22][30] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[31] and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World,[22] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[32][33] Pitt took on the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[34] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[35] proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk."[36] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[5] and thought it was one of his "weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for."[5] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better."[35][36] In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the abusive husband of Lewis' character, in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as "outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace."[37] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing comic relief to the action film.[38] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[39] Breakthrough (1994–1998) In 1994, Pitt portrayed the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name.[40] He was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[40] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[41] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, "Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis."[42] Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[43] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[44] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[45] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[46] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, "Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way."[47] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[48] In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer who preys on people he considers guilty of the Seven Deadly Sins.[49] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[50] He expressed his intent to move on from "this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws."[51] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a "determined, energetic, creditable job" as the detective.[52] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[32] Following the success of Seven, Pitt played psychotic anarchist Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of The New York Times called Twelve Monkeys "fierce and disturbing" and remarked on Pitt's "startlingly frenzied performance", concluding that he "electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film."[53] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[45] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[54] The following year, he appeared in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[55] The film received mixed reviews.[56] In the 1997 film The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[57] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[58] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; "Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[59] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[60] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide,[32] but was a critical failure.[citation needed] Later that year, he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[61] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[62] Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[63] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to "make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity."[64] Roger Ebert remarked, "Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation."[65] Rise to prominence (1999–2003) In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[66][67] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[68] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[69] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[70] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to "have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end."[71] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[72] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[73][74] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[75] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise".[76] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[77] Pitt was cast as an Irish Traveller boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[78] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[79] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was "ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been "shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;"[80] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that "Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role".[81] The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[82] a film that garnered a range of reviews[83] but enjoyed box office success.[32] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[32] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[84] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided "much of an emotional connection for the audience".[85] On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[86] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[87] In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts.[88] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[32] Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[89] and in a subsequent episode participating in his own staged abduction.[90] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[91] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[92] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[93] Worldwide recognition (2004–2008) Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[94] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[95] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[96] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[97] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[32] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as "the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford."[98] In 2005, Pitt starred as John Smith in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that "while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry".[99] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[100] For his next film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006).[101] Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that he was credible and gave the film visibility.[102] Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career.[103] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[104] and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[105] Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.[45] That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.[106] Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's Ocean's Thirteen.[107] While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office.[32] Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name.[108] Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival,[109] with Pitt playing a "scary and charismatic" role, according to Lewis Beale of Film Journal International,[110] and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival.[111] He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival.[112] As of January 2019, it was his own favorite of his films.[113] Pitt's next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy Burn After Reading, his first collaboration with the Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with The Guardian calling it "a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy",[114] noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest.[114] He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher's 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[115] with Pitt's "sensitive" performance making Benjamin Button a "timeless masterpiece", according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[116] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[117] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[45] all in the category for Best Actor. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations, and grossed $329 million at the box office worldwide.[32] Established actor (2009–present) Pitt's next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film Inglourious Basterds, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.[118] Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France.[119] The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide,[32] and garnered generally favorable reviews.[120] The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt.[121][122] He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature Megamind.[123] Pitt produced and appeared in Terrence Malick's experimental drama The Tree of Life, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[124] In a performance that attracted strong praise, he portrayed the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in the drama Moneyball, which is based on the 2003 book of the same name written by Michael Lewis.[125] Moneyball received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt.[126] His next role was as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik's 2012 Killing Them Softly, based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins.[127] In 2013, Pitt starred in World War Z, a thriller about a zombie apocalypse, based on Max Brooks's novel of the same name. Pitt also produced the film.[128] World War Z grossed $540 million at the box office worldwide,[32] becoming Pitt's highest grossing picture.[129] Next in 2013, he produced, and played a small role in, 12 Years a Slave, a historical drama based on the autobiography of Solomon Northup.[130] The film received critical acclaim[131] and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture.[132] Also in 2013, Pitt had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's The Counselor.[133] Plan B Entertainment landed its first television series on the 2013–2014 schedule, as their joint venture with ABC Studios, the sci-fi/fantasy drama Resurrection, was picked up by ABC.[134] Pitt starred in Fury, a World War II film directed and written by David Ayer, and co-starring Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, Michael Peña, and Jason Isaacs.[135][136][137] The film was released on October 17, 2014.[135] By the end of its run, Fury proved to be a commercial and critical success; it grossed more than $211 million worldwide[32] and received highly positive reviews from critics.[138] In 2015, Pitt starred opposite his wife, Jolie, in her third directorial effort, By the Sea, a romantic drama about a marriage in crisis, based on her screenplay. The film was their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Pitt's next role came with the biographical comedy-drama The Big Short, which he also produced and also co-starred alongside Christian Bale, Steve Carell, and Ryan Gosling. The film was a commercial and critical success. It went on to gross over $102 million worldwide[139] and received positive reviews from critics.[140][141] The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, earning Pitt his third Academy Award nomination as producer.

"We have to make sure that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find", he said.[165] In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.[166] Pitt supports One Campaign, an organization aimed at combating AIDS and poverty in the developing world.[167][168] He narrated the 2005 PBS public television series Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge, which discusses current global health issues.[169] The following year Pitt and Jolie flew to Haiti, where they visited a school supported by Yéle Haïti, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician Wyclef Jean.[170] In May 2007, Pitt and Jolie donated $1 million to three organizations in Chad and Sudan dedicated to those affected by the crisis in the Darfur region.[171] Along with Clooney, Damon, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, Pitt is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch, an organization that focuses global attention on stopping "mass atrocities".[172] Pitt has a sustained interest in architecture,[173] even taking time away from film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry.[174] He narrated e2 design, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design.[175] In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A.

Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[204] Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005.[204] Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston "check in with each other", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.[205] During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. Jolie and Pitt stated that they fell in love on the set[206][207] and that there was no infidelity.[206] In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie, and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. Throughout 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple "Brangelina".[208] On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time.[209] Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together.[210] They were legally married on August 14, 2014, and had their wedding in a private ceremony at the Château Miraval, France on August 23, 2014.[211] On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.[212] On April 12, 2019, the divorce became legal.[213] In 2022, he began dating Ines de Ramon (b. 1992), a jewelry designer.[214] Children In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, a girl.[215][216] On December 3, 2005, Pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of Jolie's daughter, and Jolie's first adopted child, a boy.[217] On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie's request to change the children's surnames from "Jolie" to "Jolie-Pitt".[218] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[219] Jolie gave birth to their daughter in Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would qualify for a Namibian passport.[220] The couple sold the first pictures of their daughter through the distributor Getty Images; the North American rights were purchased by People for over $4.1 million, while Hello! obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children.[221] Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a wax figure of the two-month-old; it marked the first time an infant had been honoured with a statue in the museum.[222] On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a 3-year-old boy from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[223] Pitt adopted the boy in the United States on February 21, 2008.[224] At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins.[225] She gave birth to son and daughter on July 12, 2008 in Nice, France.[226] The rights for the first images of the twins were jointly sold to People and Hello! for $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken.[227][228] The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[227][229] Since Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016, they have been embroiled in a custody battle over their children. Jolie had full custody until May 2021 when Pitt was granted joint custody, over four and a half years after proceedings began.[230] However, in July, Los Angeles superior court judge John W. Ouderkirk was removed from the case due to concerns over his impartiality as he did not sufficiently disclose business relationships with Pitt's lawyers. This resulted in the custody arrangement reverting to a previous November 2018 agreement where Jolie has primary physical custody while Pitt has "custodial time" with their minor children.[231][232] Abuse allegation In September 2016, the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigated Pitt for child abuse following an incident on a plane, where Pitt was accused by an anonymous person of being "verbally abusive" and "physical" towards one of his children.[233] Pitt was not criminally charged for the incident by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, or by the FBI.[234] In 2022, Jolie filed a countersuit against Pitt during a legal battle over their formerly co-owned vineyard. Jolie's lawyers stated that during negotiations, Pitt had asked Jolie to sign "a nondisclosure agreement prohibiting her from speaking outside of court about his abuse of her and their children."[235] Her complaint stated that he grabbed and shook her during the plane ride, strangled one of their children, and struck another in the face, among other allegations.[235] Alcohol and drug use In September 2016, Pitt got sober and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.[236] In December 2019, he wrote an article for Interview in which he talked with his Legends of the Fall and Meet Joe Black costar and fellow recovering alcoholic Anthony Hopkins about their experiences with addiction and recovery.[237] Pitt credits fellow actor Bradley Cooper with helping him in his sobriety.[238] Pitt has admitted to using cannabis in the late 1990s as a way to deal with his increasing fame.[239][240] According to Pitt: "I was hiding out from the celebrity thing; I was smoking way too much dope; I was sitting on the couch and just turning into a doughnut."[239][240][241] He reduced his cannabis use and focused on his work after a trip to Morocco, where he witnessed extreme poverty and suffering.[239][240] Prosopagnosia In 2022, Pitt said that he had struggled for years to recognize people's faces due to prosopagnosia (face blindness).[242] In a 2013 interview, he said that his inability to recognize people's faces had become so severe that he often wanted to stay home.[243] Formally, however, Pitt has not been diagnosed with prosopagnosia.[242][244] Artworks Pitt has an interest in art, learned pottery,[245] and has created sculptures. Nine of his sculptures were exhibited together with works by musician Nick Cave and artist Thomas Houseago at the Sara Hildén Art Museum in Tampere, Finland in 2022–2023.[246][247] Public image Pitt has been described as a sex symbol by many sources, including Empire, who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995.[12][248][249] The same year, he was named People's Sexiest Man Alive, an accolade he received again in 2000.[248][250] Pitt appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities from 2006 to 2008 placing at numbers 20, 5 and 10, respectively.[251][252][253] In 2007, he appeared on the Time 100 list, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by Time magazine.[254] The magazine credited Pitt for using "his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch".[254] He was again included on the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the "Builders and Titans" list.[255] Beginning in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the world's most reported celebrity stories. After Jolie was confirmed to be pregnant in early 2006, the intense media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled "The Brangelina fever," called "the point of insanity".[256] To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter, which was described by a paparazzi blog as "the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ."[257] Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement of Jolie's second pregnancy two years later; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.[258] In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, were found to be the favorite celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide.[259] Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.[260] Other commercial appearances came in television spots including Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model Tatiana Sorokko,[261] as well as SoftBank, and Edwin Jeans.[262] On June 2, 2015, the minor planet 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.[263] References External links

News • Brad Pitt (born December 18, 1963, Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S.) is an American actor known for his portrayal of unconventional characters. After gaining attention for his role in Thelma & Louise (1991), Pitt channeled his magnetism as a leading man in such movies as A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994) but avoided being typecast by assuming unorthodox roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and Fight Club (1999). Pitt won an Academy Award for his performance in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019). Early life and work Pitt grew up in Springfield, Missouri, and attended (1983–87) the University of Missouri before dropping out just short of graduation to move to California and pursue an acting career. After playing minor television and movie roles, Pitt captured the public’s attention as a charming scoundrel in the film Thelma & Louise. He followed up with such movies as A River Runs Through It, Interview with the Vampire, and Legends of the Fall (1994). Pitt then starred as a police detective in the gritty thriller Se7en (1995) and as a demented malcontent in the fantasy 12 Monkeys (1995), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar. Fight Club, Ocean’s trilogy, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith Pitt deliberately played against type as Austrian mountain climber Heinrich Harrer in Seven Years in Tibet (1997), an Irish Republican Army terrorist in The Devil’s Own (1997), a modern-day personification of death in Meet Joe Black (1998), and an underground boxer in Fight Club (1999). In 2000 Pitt married actress Jennifer Aniston. The following year he starred in Ocean’s Eleven, a comedy caper about con artists. The film was a major success and led to the sequels Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007). In 2004 Pitt portrayed the Greek warrior Achilles in Troy. The action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) paired Pitt with actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he became romantically involved. Pitt continued to lend his talents to films covering a wide range of subject matter, including Babel (2006), a film that traces the intersecting lives of characters from divergent backgrounds, and the period western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007). Pitt further demonstrated his versatility in 2008, portraying a dim-witted would-be blackmailer in the Coen brothers’ Burn After Reading and a man who ages backward in the poignant fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. His chameleonic turn in the latter film earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. Inglourious Basterds and Moneyball In 2009 Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, a World War II drama about a group of Jewish American soldiers trained to kill Nazis in German-occupied France. The following year Pitt provided the voice of the superhero rival of the titular villain in the animated film Megamind. In Terrence Malick’s impressionistic drama The Tree of Life (2011), he played a domineering father in 1950s Texas. Pitt later scored another best actor Oscar nomination, for his performance as real-life general manager Billy Beane in the baseball drama Moneyball (2011). The film chronicles how Beane assembled successful teams with the Oakland Athletics by using statistics to acquire cheaper, less-well-known players. Pitt subsequently starred as a mob enforcer in the crime drama Killing Them Softly (2012) and as a former United Nations investigator fighting to contain a zombie pandemic in the thriller World War Z (2013). Pitt had supporting roles in 12 Years a Slave (2013)—which was based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free person of color who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the mid-19th century—and in the crime drama The Counselor (2013). In Fury (2014) he played an American army sergeant commanding the remnants of a decimated battalion during the last days of World War II. The following year Pitt reteamed with Jolie, this time in By the Sea, a marital drama she also wrote and directed. He then portrayed a morally grounded former investment banker in the black comedy The Big Short (2015), about the 2008 financial crisis. In the World War II thriller Allied (2016), Pitt starred as a Canadian intelligence officer whose wife (Marion Cotillard) might be a German spy. In 2017 he portrayed a four-star general in War Machine, a military satire that was released on Netflix. Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood and later movies Pitt later reteamed with Tarantino in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019), playing the stunt double of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) in 1969 Los Angeles. For his performance, Pitt earned both an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor. Also in 2019 he starred as an astronaut searching the solar system for his missing father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) in the futuristic drama Ad Astra. Pitt’s credits from 2022 include the action-romance The Lost City, in which he had a memorable cameo, and Bullet Train, about a group of assassins on a high-speed train. That year he also costarred with Margot Robbie in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon, a dramedy set in Hollywood during the 1920s. In 2024 Pitt and Clooney reunited for Wolfs, an action comedy in which they played rival fixers who are forced to work together. In addition to acting, Pitt headed his own film-production company, Plan B Entertainment. The company partnered with several others to produce 12 Years a Slave, and Pitt won an Academy Award for his producing role when that film was named best picture. Personal life and humanitarian causes Pitt’s involvement with Jolie and his 2005 divorce from Aniston were intensely scrutinized by the tabloid press. In 2006 Pitt adopted Jolie’s two children, Maddox and Zahara, whom she had adopted from Cambodia and Ethiopia, respectively. The couple had their first biological child, Shiloh, in May 2006. The next year they adopted a boy, Pax, from Vietnam, and in 2008 they added biological twins, Knox and Vivienne, to their family. Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, but two years later Jolie filed for divorce. The couple often used their celebrity status as a platform for speaking out on behalf of a number of humanitarian causes. Pitt cofounded and was actively involved in Not on Our Watch, a campaign that directed resources to developing countries in crisis, notably the Sudanese province of Darfur. In 2006 he established the Make It Right Foundation, a multimillion-dollar project to construct environmentally friendly homes in New Orleans for people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The undertaking attracted numerous high-profile architects, but it was plagued by construction issues that resulted in several legal disputes. Notably, in 2015 the foundation sued the wood supplier after a number of completed homes began rotting; the suit was settled out of court. Three years later homeowners filed a class-action lawsuit against the foundation, alleging poor construction; in 2022 Make It Right agreed to pay the plaintiffs $20.5 million. Pitt was also interested in art, and in 2022 he exhibited a number of sculptures at a museum in Finland. His “brutally honest” works included a miniature house assembled from tree bark and tape.

Brad Pitt News: Actor’s New Movie Wolfs Premieres Brad Pitt has returned to the big screen with pal George Clooney in the action-comedy Wolfs. The 60-year-old Pitt portrays Nick, a professional fixer, who is forced to work with his rival in covering up a high-profile crime despite both men preferring to act alone. Wolfs first premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, where it received a 5-minute ovation. After a week-long run in select theaters September 20, the movie began streaming on Apple TV+ September 27. Wolfs marks the first time Pitt has shared the screen with Clooney in 16 years, with the pair last working together in the 2008 movie Burn After Reading. Pitt told Deadline the new movie was the perfect project for the two actors to reunite. “We kind of figured there’s gotta be a good reason to get back in a film together, something we feel like we could build upon what we’ve done before,” he said. “But also, I gotta say, as I get older, working with the people that I just really enjoy spending time with has really become important to me.” A Wolfs sequel is already in the works. Jump to: Who Is Brad Pitt? Academy Award–winning actor Brad Pitt is one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood since his rise in the 1990s. His major movie roles have included Ocean’s Eleven, Troy, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Moneyball, and Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood, for which he won an Oscar. Initially cast in many pretty boy roles, Pitt first proved his willingness to take on grittier roles in the 1999 cult classic Fight Club and began earning more serious award consideration following his 2006 performance in Babel. The Midwest native has also proved to be a successful movie producer, backing the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave among many others. Pitt is also known for his high-profile marriages with fellow actors Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. His current girlfriend is fashion executive Ines de Ramon. Quick Facts FULL NAME: William Bradley PittBORN: December 18, 1963BIRTHPLACE: Shawnee, OklahomaSPOUSES: Jennifer Aniston (2000-2005) and Angelina Jolie (2014-2019)CHILDREN: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and VivienneASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius Young Brad Pitt Brad Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The eldest of three children in a devoutly Southern Baptist family, Brad grew up in Springfield, Missouri, with his siblings Doug and Julie. His father, Bill Pitt, owned a trucking company, and his mother, Jane Pitt, was a family counselor. As a student at Kickapoo High School, Brad participated in school musicals but originally wanted to be an advertising art director. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri in pursuit of that goal, but a quieter aspiration that was the product of his childhood love of movies—to become an actor—began to grow louder. His dreams finally seemed tangible his last semester at university when he realized, “I can leave.” On a whim, Brad dropped out of college just two credits shy of a degree, packed up his Datsun, and headed west to Los Angeles. Brad told his parents he intended to enroll in the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, but instead spent the next several months driving a limousine. He chauffeured strippers from one bachelor party to the next and delivered refrigerators while trying to break into the Los Angeles acting scene. He joined an acting class and, shortly after, accompanied a classmate as her scene partner on an audition with an agent. In a twist of fate, the agent signed Brad instead of his partner. After weathering only seven months in Los Angeles, Pitt had secured an agent and regular acting work. Movies Pitt’s first acting jobs came in television. The 5-foot-11 actor appeared in episodes of Dallas, the daytime soap Another World, the sitcom Growing Pains, and in 1990’s short-lived Fox series Glory Days. In 1989, Pitt played Billy Canton, the drug-addicted pimp of a teenage runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the NBC made-for-television movie Too Young to Die. His big-screen debut was in 1989’s horror movie Cutting Class with Donovan Leitch. Pitt then played a teen track star in Sandy Tung’s Across the Tracks (1990). It was a well-timed bit part in a controversial Hollywood film that pushed Pitt to the brink of stardom. Thelma & Louise and A River Runs Through It Pitt’s performance as a renegade, sugar-tongued hitchhiker who gets picked up by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon’s characters in Thelma & Louise (1991) grabbed universal attention despite only a few minutes’ worth of screen time in the Ridley Scott–directed movie. Pitt’s combination of charming bad-boy charisma and sensual playfulness—particularly in a fiery love scene with Davis—made him a genuine sex symbol. The young actor’s next few movies failed to boost his acting credibility and establish him as more than just a pretty face in Hollywood. But in fall 1992, the Hollywood sunshine set the golden boy alight once more in Robert Redford’s film A River Runs Through It, based on Norman McLean’s autobiography. For his first major movie role, Pitt played Paul McLean, the gambling, fly-fishing younger brother of Craig Sheffer’s Norman. Redford later admitted he didn’t choose Pitt on the strength of his audition but rather because “[he] had an inner conflict that was very interesting to me.” Pitt delivered a sparkling performance, skillfully depicting Paul’s dangerous footing between overwhelming charm and reckless self-destructiveness. In 1993, Pitt reteamed with then-girlfriend Juliette Lewis in Dominic Sela’s Kalifornia. Pitt played Early Grayce, a man who goes on a cross-country killing spree with his girlfriend. Many reviewers deemed the movie self-indulgently violent and nihilistic, and it didn’t do well at the box office, either. Pitt and Lewis broke up soon after filming, creating a publicity disaster. Interview With the Vampire Pitt proceeded to lighten his repertoire with a comedic performance as Floyd, a burnt-out hippie in True Romance (1993), but his next major role came in the adaptation of Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire (1994), alongside Tom Cruise and a young Kirsten Dunst. Rice initially expressed outrage at the casting choices, finding the two boyish, all-American movie stars too rough for the homoerotic overtones of the tale. “It’s like casting Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer,” she reportedly complained. However, after seeing the end result, Rice retracted her initial statements and filmed a short spot for the video version that endorsed the movie. Film critic Caryn James of The New York Times noted, “the power of the film depends on Mr. Pitt’s rich and deeply affecting performance. Low-key and serene, he makes Louis convincing as a bereaved father, lover, even son.” Legends of the Fall, Seven, and Oscar Nod for 12 Monkeys Pitt’s next few efforts secured his place as a Hollywood staple even as many critics found his roles lacking in dimension. In 1994’s Legends of the Fall, an epic family melodrama, Pitt played the stereotypical romantic hero Tristan who had long, golden locks and a penchant for alternately selfish and self-sacrificing gestures. The actor earned his first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. The next year, Pitt took an abruptly gritty turn as a detective on the trail of a serial killer in David Fincher’s disturbing and gory thriller Seven. Morgan Freeman played Pitt’s onscreen partner as Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow tackled other roles. At the end of 1995, Pitt starred as a mental patient in Terry Gilliam’s psychological thriller 12 Monkeys. The actor won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Movie and earned his first Oscar nod. Pitt followed with another dark thriller, Sleepers (1996), then Devil’s Own (1997) with Harrison Ford before heading to Argentina to film Seven Years in Tibet (1997), an ambitious $70 million project that was met with mixed reviews. His next film, the three-hour Meet Joe Black, co-starring Anthony Hopkins, found Pitt playing a very comely version of death and didn’t inspire high praise. Fight Club and Ocean’s Eleven In 1999, after a brief hiatus from the Hollywood hot list, Pitt reteamed with Seven director David Fincher to make Fight Club. The cult classic, also starring Edward Norton, presented an uninhibited Pitt in the disturbing role of Tyler Durden, leader of the titular fight club that serves as a bloody diversion for young professional men. Next up for Pitt was the British crime-caper Snatch (2000), co-starring Benicio Del Toro and directed by Guy Ritchie. The year 2001 was busy for the actor. In addition to submitting an Emmy-nominated guest appearance on Friends, Pitt starred with Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican, teamed with Robert Redford again in the thriller Spy Game, and joined an A-list ensemble cast—including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Roberts—in Steven Soderbergh’s remake of Ocean’s Eleven. The heist movie was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2001 worldwide and spurred three sequels. Pitt returned for Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007), both popular yet slightly less successful entries in the franchise. (Sandra Bullock led the largely female cast of Ocean’s Eight in 2018.) Related Story Troy, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Babel The same year as Ocean’s Twelve, Pitt starred in the blockbuster epic Troy (2004), based on The Iliad by Homer. He portrayed the Greek hero Achilles and led a cast that included Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Troy made just shy of $500 million at the global box office. In 2005, Pitt starred opposite Angelina Jolie in another blockbuster, the action flick Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Showcasing a married couple who both secretly work as spies, the movie earned more than $478 million worldwide. The two actors soon became a real-life couple. Mr. and Mrs. Smith was later adapted into a TV show by Donald Glover. The critically acclaimed drama Babel (2006) earned Pitt his third Golden Globe nomination, as the movie itself was an Oscar contender for Best Picture. The actor moved on to less serious fare in Burn After Reading (2008), a FBI comedic thriller directed by the Joel and Ethan Coen that earned two Golden Globe nominations. Oscar Nods for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Moneyball Pitt took on arguably his most fantastical lead role to date in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), an Academy Award–wining movie based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The movie saw Pitt reunite with director David Fincher and Babel co-star Cate Blanchett. Pitt portrayed the title character who is born as a 70-year-old man, ages in reverse, and falls in love with Blanchett’s character, Daisy. His lauded performance earned Pitt multiple award nominations, including a nod for Best Actor at the Oscars. In 2009, Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds followed by the award-winning The Tree of Life, with Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain, two years later. But his big role for 2011 revolved around a baseball diamond. The movie star was the lead player in Moneyball, a baseball dramedy based on the identically titled 2003 nonfiction book by Michael Lewis. The story follows the travails of Oakland A’s general manager Billy Beane, who Pitt portrayed, and his quest to reshape his team. Pitt also helped produced Moneyball, which earned six Academy Award nominations that included Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt. Another Michael Lewis–Inspired Movie Academy Award for 12 Years a Slave In 2013, Pitt won acclaim for his performance as Gerry Lane in the zombie-apocalyptic thriller World War Z and also appeared as a supporting character in The Counselor. Rave reviews piled up for his work on another 2013 movie, 12 Years a Slave. The Steve McQueen–directed film tells the true story of free Black musician Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Pitt appeared as a Canadian carpenter who greatly aids Northup. The cast also included Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong’o, Michael Fassbender, and Quvenzhané Wallis. The Real Man from 12 Years a Slave For his work as a producer, Pitt won his first Oscar when 12 Years a Slave was named Best Picture in March 2014. He shared the accolade with McQueen and their fellow producers. “I know I speak for everyone standing behind me that it has been an absolute privilege to work on Solomon’s story,” Pitt said during his acceptance speech. “And we all get to stand up here tonight because of one man who brought us all together to tell that story and that is the indomitable Mr. Steve McQueen.” That August, Pitt also collected his first Emmy Award for executive producing The Normal Heart (2014). The HBO film, starring Mark Ruffalo as a gay man in 1980s New York City at the start of the HIV/AIDS crisis, was named Outstanding Television Movie. Fury and The Big Short After starring as an army sergeant in the World War II action-drama Fury (2014), Pitt’s next project was with his then-wife Angelina Jolie. The couple co-starred in the art house outing By the Sea (2015), which Jolie wrote and directed. Pitt then worked on another movie inspired by a best-selling Michael Lewis book. The Big Short (2015) focused on the housing market bubble that fueled the 2008 financial collapse and a group of men who’d predicted the turmoil to come. Pitt’s role as Ben Rickert was part of that bunch, and he additionally served as a producer of the Oscar-nominated film that competed for Best Picture. Other cast members included Steve Carell, Christian Bale, and Ryan Gosling. Academy Award for Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Pitt returned to a World War II–era period piece in the 2016 romantic thriller Allied, with co-star Marion Cotillard, then continued on a military theme with 2017’s War Machine. His character in the satirical movie was based on former U.S. General Stanley McChrystal. With Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019), Pitt finally scored a long-elusive Academy Award for acting. The movie, directed by Quentin Tarantino, had an all-star cast that placed Pitt in the company of Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Austin Butler, and Al Pacino. Pitt’s supporting role as Cliff Booth led to his second Golden Globe and a moment of reflection during his Oscar acceptance speech: Before 2019 was over, Pitt also headlined the sci-fi adventure Ad Astra. Recent and New Movies: Wolfs and F1 In 2022, Pitt made a cameo appearance in The Lost City, starred in Bullet Train as an unlucky assassin who wants his gigs to go more peacefully, and headlined Babylon as movie star Jack Conrad in a story about people trying to make it big in 1920s Hollywood. He competed for the Best Supporting Actor in a Movie trophy at the subsequent Golden Globes but didn’t win. Pitt’s new movie is the action comedy Wolfs, in which he plays a professional fixer who is forced to work with his rival (played by George Clooney) despite both men being lone wolves. The movie premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival ahead of a limited theatrical run and its Apple TV+ streaming release in September. A Wolfs sequel has already been confirmed. In 2025, Pitt is set to star in the sports action film F1 as a Formula 1 race car driver. He has also announced plans to produce both a movie and a docuseries about the Isle of Man TT motorcycle race. Preparing for F1 Net Worth As of August 2024, Pitt has an estimated net worth of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He earns a minimum of $20 million per movie, making him one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. His largest upfront salary was for his new movie Wolfs; he was paid $35 million. In addition to acting, Pitt co-founded a production company in 2001 with his then-wife Jennifer Aniston and then-manager Brad Grey. Plan B Entertainment has produced many successful and award-winning movies such as The Departed (2006), 12 Years a Slave (2013), Women Talking (2022), and Wolfs (2024). Pitt assumed sole ownership of Plan B in 2005 following his and Aniston’s divorce and sold a major stake in the company in 2022. The deal was reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars but less than $500 million. Relationships: Girlfriend, Angelina Jolie, and Jennifer Aniston As one of Hollywood’s most recognizable stars since the 1990s, Pitt’s romantic relationships have been closely watched. The actor has been part of several high-profile couples over the years, including his marriages to fellow actors Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. Pitt is currently dating fashion executive Ines de Ramon as he continues divorce proceedings from Jolie. 1990s: Juliette Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow After being tied to a handful of women in the 1980s, including actor Christina Applegate, Pitt began a four-year relationship with actor Juliette Lewis in 1989. The two met on the set of Too Young To Die? and became close despite their 10-year age difference. Lewis was just 17 when they first met. She and Pitt also shared the screen in 1993’s Kalifornia, but their breakup after filming caused headaches during the movie’s promotion campaign. Pitt moved on with another co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow. Then a relatively unknown actor, she and Pitt appeared as a married couple in Seven. In real life, both claimed it was “love at first sight” after meeting on the movie’s set around early 1995. Pitt and Paltrow stayed together for two and a half years and were one of Hollywood’s most admired couples. Then, in 1997, after a seven-month engagement, the couple split for unknown reasons. Ex-Wife Jennifer Anniston (1998-2005) Pitt next started dating Friends star Jennifer Aniston in 1998, with the couple announcing their engagement just one year later. Pitt and Aniston got married in September 2000 in a lavish beachside ceremony in Malibu, California. Read Her Biography In 2001, Pitt guest starred in an episode of Friends and the following year, the pair co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment. After five years of marriage, Pitt and Aniston announced their separation in January 2005, divorcing in October of that year. Following their divorce, the Troy actor became the sole owner of Plan B Entertainment. In 2007, Pitt maintained he still had a “deep friendship” with Aniston. Ex-Wife Angelina Jolie (2005-2019) Soon after his separation from Jennifer Aniston, Pitt began dating Angelina Jolie. Jolie later revealed the two developed feelings for each other on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005). Read Her Biography The relationship quickly became serious. In 2005, Pitt began adoption paperwork for Jolie’s two kids at the time, Maddox and Zahara. Over the next three years, the couple added four more children to their family: Shiloh, Pax, and twins Knox and Vivienne. The children all had the hyphenated last name Jolie-Pitt. (Shiloh is in the process of dropping Pitt from her last name.) Six kids and seven years later, Pitt and Jolie became engaged in 2012 and tied the knot in a private ceremony on August 23, 2014, in France. However, the union only lasted a small fraction of their time together as a couple. In September 2016, Jolie filed for divorce and requested sole custody of their children. The drama surrounding their ongoing, contentious split has played out the media. Jolie was said to be in danger of losing custody in June 2018 due to her insistence on keeping the children from seeing their father. That August, Jolie filed court documents that claimed her estranged husband had “paid no meaningful child support since separation.” Pitt’s legal team followed with their own filing that they asserted the actor had paid more than $1.3 million in bills for the family and helped Jolie buy her current home through an $8 million loan. A judge ruled Pitt and Jolie legally single in April 2019, though the former couple’s divorce has yet to be fully finalized. In October 2022, Jolie filed a complaint alleging that Pitt was physically abusive to her and their six children during a 2016 plane ride, which led to their divorce. Jolie said he “choked one of the children and struck another in the face” and grabbed her “by the head and shook her.” She also stated Pitt poured alcohol all over her and the kids. Two years later, in April 2024, Jolie issued a new legal filing claiming that Pitt’s abuse started long before the 2016 incident. Current Girlfriend Ines de Ramon Pitt started dating Swiss luxury jewelry executive Ines de Ramon in late 2022. The couple was first spotted together that November before attending the Babylon movie premiere a month later. Pitt and his girlfriend reportedly moved in together in February 2024 and made their first red carpet appearance at the Venice Film Festival in September. Children Pitt is a father to six adopted and biological children who he shares with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie. From oldest to youngest, they are Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne. Soon after he and Jolie began their relationship, Pitt filed paperwork in 2005 to adopt Maddox, born in 2001, and Zahara, born in 2005. Next, the couple had a daughter who they named Shiloh in May 2006. Their brood grew again in 2007 with the adoption of 3-year-old Pax, who was born in 2003. Then, in July 2008, Jolie had fraternal twins: a son named Knox and a daughter named Vivienne. Although Jolie sought full custody of their kids, Pitt was awarded joint custody of the children in May 2021. That ruling was overturned months later due to a legal technicality, then in October 2022, Jolie said in a court filing that Pitt had been physically and verbally abusive on a plane ride six years earlier. Amid the ongoing divorce, Pitt’s children have distanced themselves from him, with Zahara, Shiloh, and Vivienne choosing to adopt their mother’s last name. Shiloh began the official process to change her last name from Jolie-Pitt to just Jolie in May 2024. In a now deleted Instagram story, Pitt’s son Pax reportedly had some choice words for him on Father’s Day in 2020, calling the actor a “terrible and despicable person.” Quotes The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.
