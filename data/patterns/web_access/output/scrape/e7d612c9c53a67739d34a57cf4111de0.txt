The WiFi has been awful on my last few Delta Air Lines flights. Only one side of the heafphone jack work. Crew was friendly and helpful. Luggage delayed and 6 days later I still don't have it. In thirty years of traveling, mostly with Delta, this was the worst day ever. It was reported to the passengers that Delta failed to schedule the crew properly. This error caused the pilot to show up about 30 minutes late. All in all Delta's inability to take care of this basic function resulted in about an hour delay. Loyal Delta traveler, but last nights flight was a train wreck. Seated in 1B after multiple delays. Then we couldn’t takeoff because of an issue with the passenger that was ‘not in compliance’ and had to deplane along with the threat if they did not deplane, all the passengers would be required to do so. Finally they were escorted off, but the experience threw off the crew. Disruptive for everyone. Service was a mess, televisions didn’t work, bathroom door kept swinging open during the entire flight whenever empty … Older plane and it came with Fleas and flea bites! All good on Delta's part. Passengers could be a little more courteous to each other. The fight was about 2 1/2 hours delayed, but that was weather related. The flight was also overbooked. But we were in Comfort plus so the flight was fine for us. Awful. Flight was continuously getting delayed and gates kept changing without any reason. Flight was delayed for more then 3 hours Late out of the gate, late to takeoff. No screens on plane. Uncomfortable window seat. Everything was very good. Was able to change a make run flight leaving on direct earlier in the app -seamless!!! Well done Haven’t used United in a while. Was surprised with the free blanket and earphones. Service was great. Huge plane. 9/.row. Your seats in the last 5 rows are terrible. My knees were jammed into the seat in front of me and the lady sitting there decided to recline it. Jammed my knees bad. I don’t know if I’ll fly United again. Pot and crew did a tremendous job landing in Savannah in the middle of the tropical storm. !! Delays!!! Serious delays. I was told by a member of staff in LGA that I would miss my DEN to LAX flight connection, so I was put on a later flight. Due to delays I would have been able to have made my original flight, where I was sat in business class - seat 1A: I was put on my original flight but bumped from business - 1A to economy 33C. I want a refund for paying business class but only flying economy Boarding was efficient. Crew was not pleasant and skipped me during a round of beverage service. Older plane with no seat back screens and I couldn’t connect to wifi or their entertainment offerings. Original plane sidelined. Had to wait an hour for replacement. Fantastic. Smooth boarding with an infant. Never experienced it with any other carriers. An hour and a half late is UNACCEPTABLE. The negative impact to our family is unconscionable. And for the price we were forced to pay... The flight attendants were talking the entire time on the back and I couldn’t even take a nap. Super annoying Had to wait a long time for wheelchair in Dallas Flight was good. However, they had everyone board the plane then made us sit there on the tarmac for an hour plus due to maintenance issues. Besides that flight attendant and pilot were amazing. Was able to get on early due to being short of breathe. Agents very helpful. It was really good. The boarding was good and smooth. They even checked our carry ons if you wanted to without any charge. Always a great flight on AA. PHX to DFW and vise versa is always going to be a pretty full flight but the crew handles it phenomenally. Not too impressed with them to be honest. They had forgotten my gf meal, despite the fact that the app had notified me that it was sorted. Apparently there is a ‘glitch’ in the system, according to one of the stewardesses, and has been for a while. Also the legroom in economy is way too small (and I’m a slight person) and are very uncomfortable. An extra Internal flight I booked via the app, had not even given me the option to order a meal, so was unaware of that and left without food on a 9 hr. flight !! Don’t think I’ll use AA again after this. Experience was fine. Seats were cramped, and we had to wait for repairs before we could take of. Even though the door remained open, we were warned that leaving the plane could cause difficulty trying to fly out later. Staff was pleasant, and climate control was fortunately working. We had trouble at the DFW terminal, but I don't think that was AA's fault. No complaints. Good WiFi, great crew and excellent speedy baggage claim There were several different delays but we ended up being delayed a total of 40 mins or so. It was annoying we had a gate change which made it take longer to leave DFW, and we had to check our carry on. Ugh Staying with Dallas 4 hour stay ...it's was torture sorry. .. about to say that Customer service. There is no way to call them and online chat doesn't deal with your specific concerns. I don't plan to fly spirit again. Better overall experience from my first flight with Spirit several years ago. Efficient boarding (albeit I arrived after all rows were called) and flight actually left earlier than planned. I am still baffled by being charged for everything, even a non-alcoholic beverage. And there is definitely less seat room which makes a flight that’s more than 2 hours really uncomfortable. The plane crew made the decision to leave a LARGE group of us passengers who were stuck literally at the gate next to the Las Vegas flight & trying to get off. We were lied to & told the Vegas to Dallas plane was going to wait for us. I’m having to fly the whole night to my destination now because of this I liked the airfare price. Seats are not very comfortable. But I would fly again with Spirit for the price. For the price we paid, the service was outstanding, we took off on time, everything went very smoothly, we landed on time, and we didn't need anything extra. spirt air lines took advantage of two eighty year olds. we paid extra for cancelation due to health reasons they did not honer they have no spirit. I hope they treat there grand parents beter. Would have been better if I would’ve made it on my flight but it was delayed twice and then canceled and now I’m stuck till Monday which was and extra 5 days I did not count on . Checking one bag in after we already got our boarding passes and tag for the bag was ridiculous. Only two agents working the counter. It took forever! Second, the all male flight attendant staff was rude by yelling at those of us on the plane, being short with flyers, and speaking so fast that it was hard to understand what they were saying. Both flights were delayed. Flight from LGA to DTW caused serious anxiety as 3 people were removed from the aircraft before take off for disorderly conduct. Extremely uncomfortable to be in that situation. Staff handled themselves okay- definitely could’ve been more professional and deescalated the situation first. No apology for the delays at all. No water, no snack, no nothing. Not a good flight experience. We understand and comply with Frontier’s bag sizes. We’ve had some problems in past while having to await other passengers who do not understand the baggage restrictions or have not prepaid and that is usually our biggest concern (others delaying us) with flying Frontier. Flying OUT of ONT, however, has always been a great experience. I’ve also noted even on delayed Frontier flights very knowledgeable pilots who manage expectations well. There was no easy way to check in. I don't want to install an app to checkin. I will use alaska from now on because they have a web check in method that is easy. The crew was ghetto lol I felt like I was on an inner city field trip Horrible! The short distance flight ended up taking 5 hrs! There was a 3 hr delay for the flight to take off and there was a 70 min wait on the tarmac for some bogus reason that the pilot said the gate he was supposed to board was taken up. After a 30 min wait he said the plane that was supposed to push out of the gate called a medical emergency and 40 min later he ended up boarding another gate. For the initial 3 hr delay there was no information/alert about the gate or delay in the app or the boards up until the boarding time and even beyond! Had to walk all the way to the end of the terminal to find the frontier staff to ask what was going on. Avoid this airline at all costs! If you have carryon bags or checked bags , their prices come equivalent to the prices of more reliable airlines. They are the worst in timeliness at 60% (reported as delayed) this year (check the data) by a high margin even compared to the second worst airline. If you are ok with having a miserable flight experience with the odds close to flip of a coin, feel free to try them. If you value your time , money and flying experience, stay away. There was nothing to like, flight delayed had to move to different departure areas, disorganized to say the leasr Delayed for two hours due to trivial issues. No reimbursment. Also on arrival further delay due to terminal malfunction. Our flight was canceled for no known reason. We weren’t told until we were checking in at 5:00 am. This was after our last flight with Frontier where we sat on the plane for three hours (not an exaggeration) before we took off because of a mechanical issue. We won’t be flying Frontier again. Allowed me to chose my seat without extra charge (I purchased full-price ticket) and boarding was in group1. Didn't even serve water. I went to the Frontier counter in San Jose at 1030am or so on Sunday 10/13/24 to see if I could get an earlier flight to San Diego in lieu of my reserved 630pm flight. One thing led to another, and I was able to obtain an open seat for about $ 56. on the earlier flight. Fine. Then the agent asked if I "was checking a bag". Not knowing that carry-ons cost extra per Frontier policy, I thought that she meant a regular checked bag. Therefore, I said no. Once I got to the gate, the same gate agent who sold me a ticket told me that I had to pay $99 for a carry-on, and that all bags were extra on Frontier. Having never flown on Frontier, I was not aware of this. Part of the issue was that she was not a native English speaker, so there was a miscommunication as to what "bag" meant. I would have preferred for her to have clearly let me know at the front counter that any bag including a carry-on cost $99. It would have had the same outcome, as I had to take my carry-on. But it got hectic at the last minute at the gate itself. The baggage policy should have mentioned "including carry-ons" when we first spoke. Canceled original flight and wasn't clear on rebooked flight. Had to pay for bags which was more than the flight itself. Normal help, drinks etc. you have to pay for. This is Not a low cost airline.
