Get the Reddit app A place to find out what's going on in the greater Fresno Metro area. Recommendation on hotels? I'll be visiting in November with my wife and haven't been back to Fresno since I grew up in Visalia in the late 80s. I honestly can't remember what the city was like so I'm hoping some locals can point me in the right direction for nice hotels! (I know I can check Google, but I always like checking in with the community first). We like to drink and go out so anything that has a nice hotel bar or is in a fun area is preferred. Thanks! Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community Top Posts
