Here are the direct quotations from the document, with speakers and context:

**1.  From the majority opinion:**

* **"We are unable to conclude that Congress intended to compel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct,—to invest those who go on strike with an immunity from discharge for acts of trespass or violence against the employer’s property, which they would not have enjoyed had they remained at work."**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing the court's prior decision in *NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.* (1939).
    * Context: The Court discusses the principle that the Board's authority to choose remedies for labor violations is not unlimited, especially when those remedies might conflict with other federal laws.
* **"It is sufficient for this case to observe that the Board has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it may wholly ignore other and equally important [c]ongressional objectives."**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing the court's prior decision in *Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB* (1942).
    * Context: The Court explains that the Board cannot prioritize labor policy to the point of completely disregarding other important Congressional objectives.
* **"While the Board’s interpretation of the NLRA should be given some deference, the proposition that the Board’s interpretation of statutes outside its expertise is likewise to be deferred to is novel"**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing the court's prior decision in *NLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco* (1984).
    * Context: The Court highlights that while some deference is given to the Board's interpretation of the NLRA, it should not be given the same deference when interpreting laws outside its expertise.
* **"For whatever reason, Congress had not “made it a separate criminal offense” for employers to hire an illegal alien, or for an illegal alien “to accept employment after entering this country illegally.”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing its prior decision in *Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB* (1984).
    * Context: The Court notes that at the time of the *Sure-Tan* decision, Congress hadn't explicitly criminalized hiring or accepting employment by undocumented workers.
* **"In devising remedies for unfair labor practices, the Board is obliged to take into account another ‘equally important Congressional objective’"** 
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing its prior decision in *Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB* (1984), which itself cited *Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB* (1942).
    * Context: The Court reaffirms the principle that the Board must consider Congressional objectives beyond labor law when choosing remedies.
* **“[T]he employees must be deemed ‘unavailable’ for work (and the accrual of backpay therefore tolled) during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United States.”** 
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing its prior decision in *Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB* (1984).
    * Context:  The Court explains that backpay for undocumented workers cannot be awarded for periods when those workers were not legally entitled to be in the United States. 
* **“The question presented was “a narrow one,” limited to whether the Board was obliged to “adopt a rigid rule” that employees who testify falsely under oath automatically forfeit NLRA remedies.”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing its prior decision in *ABF Freight System, Inc. v. NLRB* (1994).
    * Context: The Court distinguishes the *ABF Freight* case, arguing that it concerned a narrower issue related to employee perjury during Board proceedings, and not illegal employment under federal immigration law. 
* **“The perjury statute provides for criminal sanctions; it does not forbid a present or potential perjurer from obtaining a job.”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, quoting the dissenting opinion of Judge Sentelle in the lower court case.
    * Context: The Court further distinguishes the *ABF Freight* case, noting that perjury, while serious, doesn't inherently invalidate an employment relationship.
* **"For whatever reason, Congress had not “made it a separate criminal offense” for employers to hire an illegal alien, or for an illegal alien “to accept employment after entering this country illegally.”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing its prior decision in *Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB* (1984).
    * Context: The Court notes that at the time of the *Sure-Tan* decision, Congress hadn't explicitly criminalized hiring or accepting employment by undocumented workers.
* **"It is the reasonably certain prospect of a backpay award” that leads employers to “shun practices of dubious legality.”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, quoting its prior decision in *Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody* (1975).
    * Context: The Court acknowledges the important deterrent effect of backpay awards in discouraging employers from engaging in questionable practices.
* **“we would leave helpless the very persons who most need protection from exploitative employer practices.”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, quoting Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion in *NLRB v. Apollo Tire Co.* (1979).
    * Context: The Court uses this quote to reinforce the importance of labor laws protecting all workers, including undocumented ones, from exploitation. 
* **“IRCA does not “undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law, or . . . limit the powers of federal or state labor relations boards . . . to remedy unfair practices committed against undocumented employees.”**
    * Speaker: Members of Congress, quoted from the House Report accompanying the IRCA.
    * Context: The Court acknowledges a statement within the IRCA legislation itself that suggests the law doesn't intend to limit the Board's ability to protect undocumented workers.
* **"[L]anguage of an opinion” must be “read in context” and not “parsed” like a statute.**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, referencing its prior decision in *Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.* (1979).
    * Context: The Court states that it will not take sentences from prior rulings out of context, but will instead consider the full context of the decision. 
* **“[T]he award provisions of the NLRA are remedial, not punitive, in nature, and thus should be awarded only to ‘workers who are illegal immigrants’ ”**
    * Speaker: Supreme Court of the United States, quoting its prior decision in *Local 512, Warehouse and Office Workers Union v. NLRB*.
    * Context: The Court acknowledges that the NLRA's provisions are intended to remedy harm, not to punish. 

**2. From the dissenting opinion:**

* **"The Board has especially broad discretion in choosing an appropriate remedy for addressing such violations."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion.
    * Context: Justice Breyer argues that the Board has broad authority in choosing remedies for labor law violations.
* **"The Board “draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion, referencing the Supreme Court's prior decision in *NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.* (1969). 
    * Context:  Justice Breyer argues that the Board has unique expertise and that reviewing courts should give its decisions special respect. 
* **"Those purposes involve more than victim compensation; they also include deterrence, i. e., discouraging employers from violating the Nation’s labor laws."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion.
    * Context: Justice Breyer emphasizes the importance of deterrence as a key goal of the Board's remedies.
* **"In the absence of the backpay weapon, employers could conclude that they can violate the labor laws at least once with impunity."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion.
    * Context: Justice Breyer argues that without the backpay remedy, employers might be tempted to violate labor laws knowing that they will only face future-oriented penalties.
* **"it is the reasonably certain prospect of a backpay award” that leads employers to “shun practices of dubious legality.”**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion, quoting the Supreme Court's prior decision in *Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody* (1975).
    * Context: Justice Breyer emphasizes the importance of backpay awards as a deterrent to questionable employer practices. 
* **"To permit the Board to award backpay could not significantly increase the strength of this magnetic force, for so speculative a future possibility could not realistically influence an individual’s decision to migrate illegally."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion.
    * Context: Justice Breyer argues that the possibility of backpay is unlikely to be a significant factor in motivating illegal immigration. 
* **"The Court has recognized these considerations in stating that the labor laws must apply to illegal aliens in order to ensure that “there will be no advantage under the NLRA in preferring illegal aliens” and therefore there will be “fewer incentives for aliens themselves to enter.”**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion, referencing the Supreme Court's prior decision in *Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB*. 
    * Context: Justice Breyer argues that the Court's decision will actually *increase* incentives for illegal immigration because it undermines the deterrent effect of labor laws on employers. 
* **“The Board acted “with a discriminating awareness of the consequences of its action” on the immigration laws.”**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion, referencing the Supreme Court's prior decision in *Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States*.
    * Context: Justice Breyer defends the Board's judgment and argues that it considered the potential impact on immigration laws.
* **"The Board reached its conclusion after carefully considering both labor law and immigration law."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion.
    * Context:  Justice Breyer defends the Board's thorough consideration of both labor and immigration law in reaching its decision.
* **"And the Board’s position is, at the least, a reasonable one. Consequently, it is lawful."**
    * Speaker: Justice Breyer, writing the dissenting opinion, referencing the Supreme Court's prior decision in *Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.* (1984). 
    * Context: Justice Breyer argues that the Board's position is reasonable and therefore should be upheld by the courts.

## Key Terms and Concepts from the Hoffman Plastic Compounds Case:

**1. National Labor Relations Act (NLRA):**  A federal law that protects the rights of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and engage in other concerted activities for mutual aid or protection.

**2. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):** An independent federal agency that enforces the NLRA. It investigates unfair labor practices and issues remedies, including backpay and reinstatement.

**3. Backpay:**  Compensation paid to an employee for wages lost due to an employer's violation of the NLRA. 

**4. Unfair Labor Practices:** Employer actions that violate the NLRA, such as firing employees for union activity or retaliating against workers for organizing.

**5. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA):** A federal law that established a system for verifying the legal status of workers and made it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented aliens. 

**6. Undocumented Alien:** An alien who is in the United States without legal authorization to work or reside.

**7. Employment Verification System:** A system established by IRCA that requires employers to verify the identity and work authorization of all new hires using specific documents.

**8. Fraudulent Documents:**  False documents, such as forged birth certificates or Social Security cards, used to establish employment eligibility.

**9. Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB (1984):**  A Supreme Court case that addressed the interaction between the NLRA and federal immigration law. The Court ruled that the NLRB's authority to remedy unfair labor practices is limited by the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act), and that undocumented workers who are not lawfully entitled to be present or employed in the United States cannot receive backpay.

**10.  ABF Freight System, Inc. v. NLRB (1994):** A Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the NLRB's ability to award backpay to an employee who committed perjury during the Board's enforcement proceedings.  The Court distinguished this case from Sure-Tan, noting that the employee's misconduct did not render the underlying employment relationship illegal.

**11.  Remedies:**  The actions taken by the NLRB to correct an unfair labor practice, such as backpay, reinstatement, or cease and desist orders.

**12.  Reinstatement:** The employer's act of rehiring an employee who was unlawfully discharged.

**13.  Cease and Desist Order:** An order issued by the NLRB requiring an employer to stop engaging in unfair labor practices.

**14.  Mitigation of Damages:** The steps taken by an employee to minimize the loss of wages following an unfair labor practice.

**15.  Deference:** The principle that courts give significant weight to agency interpretations of their own statutes.

**16.  Public Policy:** The underlying principles and values that inform the laws and regulations of a society.
