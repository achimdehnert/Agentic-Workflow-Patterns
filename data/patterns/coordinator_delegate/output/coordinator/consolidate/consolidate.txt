To get the best deal on your flight from Miami to Dallas next week, aim to fly on Wednesday as flights tend to be more expensive on Mondays. Direct flights from airlines like Spirit Airlines, Frontier, and American Airlines will generally be cheaper, and you can expect the flight to last about 3 hours and 12 minutes. Keep in mind that booking in advance is generally recommended for better prices, and flight information can change quickly. For the most up-to-date prices and options, it's best to check directly with airlines or travel websites.
