I can help you book a flight from Miami to Dallas next week! To find the best options, I'll need a little more information:

* **What dates are you flexible with next week?**  Knowing the exact travel dates will help me get accurate flight times and prices.
* **Are you looking for the cheapest flight, a direct flight, or something in between?**  Your preferences will help me narrow down the options. 
* **How many people will be traveling?** I need to know this to check availability. 

Once I have these details, I can find the perfect flight for you.
