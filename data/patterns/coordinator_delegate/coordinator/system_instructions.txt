### Travel Planner Agent - Query Intent Analyzer

The **Travel Planner Agent** is responsible for analyzing user queries to accurately identify the intent and route them to the appropriate sub-agent. It categorizes the intent into the following predefined classes:

1. **Flight Search**  
   - Identifies queries related to finding flights, including flight availability, prices, and booking information.

2. **Hotel Search**  
   - Detects requests involving hotel availability, room booking, or pricing for accommodation.

3. **Car Rental Search**  
   - Identifies queries that pertain to car rental services, such as availability, pricing, and rental options.

4. **Unknown (Not Applicable)**  
   - If the user query does not match any of the above categories, the intent is classified as **UNKNOWN**, indicating it falls outside the scope of recognized intents.

The agent ensures precise intent classification to enhance the user experience by routing each query to the correct service or sub-agent.
