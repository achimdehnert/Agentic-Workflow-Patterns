## Dialogue in "The Old Man of the Sea" by W.W. Jacobs

Here are the instances of dialogue in the story, categorized by speaker and their relationship to other characters:

**Mr. George Wright (Main Character, aspiring suitor)**

* **To Mr. Kemp (potential "rich uncle"):**
    * "What I want you to do," said Mr. George Wright, as he leaned towards the old sailor, "is to be an uncle to me."
    * "A rich uncle," continued the young man, lowering his voice to prevent any keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge.  "An uncle from New Zealand, who is going to leave me all 'is money."
    * "It don't matter," said the other.  "It'll only be for a little while, and then you'll 'ave a letter calling you back to New Zealand.  See?  And you'll go back, promising to come home in a year's time, after you've wound up your business, and leave us all your money.  See?"
    * "It'll do to go on with," he said, smelling it suspiciously.  "Have you got change for a fifty-pound note?"
    * "It's not for long," said Mr. Kemp.  "I'm just going back for about a year to wind up things out there, and then I'm coming back to leave my old bones over here.  George has very kindly offered to let me live with him."
    * "He won't suffer for it, I'll be bound," said Mrs. Bradshaw, archly.
    * "So far as money goes he won't," said the old man.  "Not that that would make any difference to George."
    * "It would be the same to me if you hadn't got a farthing," said Mr. Wright, promptly.
    * "Seems to be going all right," said Mr. Wright, as the old man made his report; "but be careful; don't go overdoing it."
    * "I dare say," he said; "but I am managing this affair, not you.  Now, you go round to-morrow afternoon and tell them you're off.  D'ye hear?  D'ye think I'm made of money?  And what do you mean by making such a fuss of that fool, Charlie Hills?  You know he is after Bella."
    * "He must go back," shouted the alarmed  Mr. Wright.
    * "A week!" shouted Mr. Wright, almost beside himself with rage and dismay.  "A week!  Another week!  Why, you told me----"
    * "What--what--do you--want it for?"  he gasped.
    * "And you can go and fetch a hansom-cab, George, while she's a-doing of it," said Mr. Kemp.  "Pick out a good 'orse--spotted-grey, if you can."
    * "Thankee, my boy," said Mr. Kemp, bluffly, as he helped Mrs. Bradshaw in and stood with his foot on the step.  "By the way, you had better go back and lock my pocket-book up.  I left it on the washstand, and there's best part of a thousand pounds in it.  You can take fifty for yourself to buy smokes with."
    * "No," said Mr. Wright, sharply; "I didn't."
    * "Well, lend me a couple of pounds, then, or else run back and fetch my pocket-book," he added, with a sly grin.
    * "You--you can't!" he gasped.
    * "And I'm to find you money to play the rich uncle with till you're married, I suppose," said Mr. Wright, in a grating voice, "and then lose Bella when Mrs. Bradshaw finds you've lost your money?"
    * "That's your lookout," he said, at last.
    * "Now, look here," said Mr. Wright, with great determination.  "Either you go and tell them that you've been telegraphed for--cabled is the proper word--or I tell them the truth."
    * "That'll settle you then," said Mr. Kemp.
    * "No more than the other would," retorted the young man, "and it'll come cheaper.  One thing I'll take my oath of, and that is I won't give you another farthing; but if you do as I tell you I'll give you a quid for luck.  Now, think it over."
    * "Yes," said Mr. Wright.
    * "I'm going now.  I've got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don't want you to come with me.  I prefer to be alone.  You stay here and cheer them up.  Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o' pounds out o' that fifty I gave you last night.  I've given all my small change away."
    * "Yes," said Mr. Wright.
    * "I'm going now.  I've got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don't want you to come with me.  I prefer to be alone.  You stay here and cheer them up.  Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o' pounds out o' that fifty I gave you last night.  I've given all my small change away."
    * "Yes," said Mr. Wright.

    * "Yes," said Mr. Wright.

    * "Yes," said Mr. Wright.
    * "I'm going now.  I've got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don't want you to come with me.  I prefer to be alone.  You stay here and cheer them up.  Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o' pounds out o' that fifty I gave you last night.  I've given all my small change away."
    * "Yes," said Mr. Wright.

* **To Bella Bradshaw (his love interest):**
    * "I suppose I shall know some day," said the young man, slowly; "but it won't be much good to me unless----"
    * "Unless?"  said Bella, after a pause.
    * "Unless it gives me what I want," replied the other.  "I'd sooner be a poor man and married to the girl I love, than a millionaire."

* **To Charlie Hills (Bella's other suitor):**
    * "I'm all right," said Mr. Wright, with dignity, as the other hooked the door open with his stick and nodded at him.
    * "Well, why don't you look it?"  demanded the lively Mr. Hills.  "Have you got your feet wet, or what?"

**Mr. Kemp (the "rich uncle", a con artist)**

* **To Mr. Wright (his accomplice):**
    * "Aye, aye," said the mystified Mr. Kemp, pausing with a mug of beer midway to his lips.
    * "Where's it coming from?"  demanded Mr. Kemp, with a little excitement.
    * "I've had money lent me before," he said, candidly, "but I can't call to mind ever paying it back.  I always meant to, but that's as far as it got."
    * "I took a fancy to you the moment I set eyes on you," rejoined Mr. Kemp.  "You're the living image of a young fellow that lent me five pounds once, and was drowned afore my eyes the week after.  He 'ad a bit of a squint, and I s'pose that's how he came to fall overboard."
    * "It's your game, not mine, and it's sure to come a bit expensive.  I can't be a rich uncle without spending a bit.  'Ow much did you say you'd got in the bank?"
    * "It's wonderful how they took it all in about me," he said; "but I feel certain in my own mind that I ought to chuck some money about."
    * "I can turn 'em round my little finger," he said.  "You'll have Bella all to yourself to-morrow evening."
    * "I didn't do it," said Mr. Kemp, equably; "they done it.  The old lady says that, just for once in her life, she wants to see how it feels to spend money like water."
    * "It don't matter to me," said Mr. Kemp.  "I can have a headache or a chill, or something of that sort, if you like.  I don't want to go.  It's no pleasure to me."
    * "I--I forgot it," said the old man.
    * "I forgot it," said the old man, doggedly.  "Besides, if you take my advice, you'd better let me stay a little longer to make sure of things."
    * "I hadn't got the heart to tell you," said Mr. Kemp.  "I don't know when I've been so happy."
    * "Well, well," said Mr. Kemp; "p'r'aps--"
    * "It's no good having money if I can't please myself."
    * "Don't you worry," he said, as the other paused from exhaustion.  "It won't be for long now."
    * "No, I don't," said Mr. Kemp, plainly.  "I'm not going back, never no more--never!  I'm going to stop here and court Mrs. Bradshaw."
    * "I've thought it all out," said Mr. Kemp, nodding.  "She mustn't know I'm not rich till after we're married; then I 'ave a letter from New Zealand saying I've lost all my money.  It's just as easy to have that letter as the one you spoke of."
    * "I'm going to have a try," said the old man.  "I'm sick of going to sea, and it'll be a nice comfortable home for my old age.  You marry Bella, and I'll marry her mother.  Happy family!"
    * "I've thought it all out," said Mr. Kemp, nodding.  "She mustn't know I'm not rich till after we're married; then I 'ave a letter from New Zealand saying I've lost all my money.  It's just as easy to have that letter as the one you spoke of."
    * "I'm going to have a try," said the old man.  "I'm sick of going to sea, and it'll be a nice comfortable home for my old age.  You marry Bella, and I'll marry her mother.  Happy family!"
    * "I'm going to have a try," said the old man.  "I'm sick of going to sea, and it'll be a nice comfortable home for my old age.  You marry Bella, and I'll marry her mother.  Happy family!"

## Identify the narrative voice and point of view of the story.
The narrative voice in "The Old Man of the Sea" is **third-person omniscient**. This means the narrator:

* **Knows everything:** The narrator is aware of all the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motivations. We see inside the minds of Mr. Wright, Mr. Kemp, Bella, and even Mr. Hills.
* **Is not a character:** The narrator is not a character in the story, but an outside observer who tells the tale.
* **Can move freely between characters:** The narrator shifts perspectives throughout the story, giving us insights into different characters' viewpoints and revealing the story's complex dynamics.

The point of view, therefore, is **external**, meaning that the story is told from the perspective of an outsider who is observing the events and characters. The narrator doesn't participate in the action, but provides an overarching view of the situation. This allows for a humorous and satirical tone, as the reader can see the absurdity of the characters' actions and the consequences of their choices from a more detached standpoint.

## Character Descriptions in "The Old Man of the Sea":

**Mr. George Wright:**

* **Physical Appearance:** Not explicitly described, but assumed to be young and possibly of average build.
* **Personality:**  Ambitious, calculating, and somewhat desperate to marry Bella.  He is willing to deceive and manipulate to achieve his goals.  Also shows signs of being easily angered and prone to panicking.

**Mr. Kemp:**

* **Physical Appearance:** Described as having a "good rolling voice" and "white whiskers."  He appears to have a rather stout physique, evidenced by his needing to "edge" his way into the parlor. 
* **Personality:**  Naive, easily gullible, and somewhat dim-witted. He is easily flattered and loves to spend money.  He also seems to lack much ambition or self-awareness, becoming content with the role of the wealthy uncle.

**Miss Bradshaw:**

* **Physical Appearance:** Described as "good-looking" and having "sparkling eyes."
* **Personality:**  Intelligent, perceptive, and somewhat wary.  She seems to be easily attracted by Mr. Wright's romantic declarations, but is also observant enough to see through Mr. Kemp's charade.  She enjoys being pampered by the supposed rich uncle.

**Mrs. Bradshaw:**

* **Personality:**  Motherly, indulgent, and easily swayed by flattery.  She enjoys the attention and extravagant gestures of Mr. Kemp.  She is also somewhat protective of her daughter.

**Mr. Hills:**

* **Physical Appearance:**  Not explicitly described, but implied to be young and attractive, with a "lively" personality.
* **Personality:**  Charming, witty, and opportunistic.  He is clearly attracted to Bella and is quick to see an opportunity to capitalize on Mr. Kemp's wealth.  He is described as being "good-'arted" and a "good-looking" young man.

**Other Characters:**

* **The unnamed young woman in the tobacconist shop:** This character is described as "good-looking" by the narrator, but has little personality beyond being a target for Mr. Wright's charade.

**Overall:**

The story focuses on a clash of personalities, with the gullible and oblivious Mr. Kemp unwittingly becoming the tool for the more ambitious and devious Mr. Wright. Miss Bradshaw and her mother provide a contrasting element of  perceptiveness and easygoing indulgence.  The story is a humorous satire of social class and ambition, using caricature to highlight the characters' flaws and motivations.

## Identify any symbols or motifs present in the text and analyze their significance.
The text, "The Old Man of the Sea", doesn't explicitly employ symbols or motifs in the traditional literary sense. However, there are a few recurring elements and themes that could be considered symbolic representations:

**Money and Wealth:**

* **The constant focus on money** throughout the story is a significant motif. It drives the actions of both Mr. Wright and Mr. Kemp. Mr. Wright uses the illusion of Mr. Kemp's wealth to win Bella's affection, while Mr. Kemp enjoys the freedom and indulgence it brings. This theme explores the corrupting influence of money and its ability to blur lines of morality.
* **The "pocket-book"** becomes a symbol of Mr. Kemp's wealth, and its presence becomes a source of conflict and tension. Mr. Wright's obsession with it highlights the power of money and its impact on relationships.

**The "Rich Uncle" persona:**

* **Mr. Kemp's transformation** into the "rich uncle" is a powerful motif. He adopts a persona that is both believable and captivating, demonstrating the malleability of identity and the power of persuasion. This motif also touches on the theme of deception and its consequences.

**The Sea:**

* **The mention of the sea** is a subtle but significant motif. Mr. Kemp's association with the sea suggests a life of adventure and freedom, but also of danger and uncertainty. It represents a world that is far removed from the mundane realities of the characters' lives, and it reinforces the notion of escape.

**Other recurring elements:**

* **Coughs:** Mr. Wright's frequent coughing serves as a symbolic manifestation of his anxiety and frustration, highlighting his growing desperation to maintain control of the situation. 
* **The cigar:** The act of smoking a cigar becomes a symbolic representation of Mr. Kemp's enjoyment of his newfound wealth and his willingness to indulge in life's pleasures.

Overall, the text doesn't rely on deeply symbolic imagery. Instead, it uses everyday objects and actions to convey broader themes of deception, greed, and the pursuit of happiness. The use of these recurring elements adds a layer of complexity to the story, inviting readers to consider the underlying motivations of the characters and the consequences of their choices.

## Extract all the instances of humor and irony in the story.
## Humor and Irony in "The Old Man of the Sea" by W.W. Jacobs:

**Humor:**

* **The premise itself:** The story is built on the absurdity of George Wright's plan to invent a rich uncle to impress Bella. The whole scheme is inherently funny, especially with the inclusion of the forgetful and easily swayed Mr. Kemp.
* **Mr. Kemp's character:**  He's a delightful character, a bit of a rogue and a charming old man with a fondness for beer and spending money. His naiveté, coupled with his enjoyment of the role of a wealthy uncle, provides a constant source of amusement.
* **Mr. Kemp's lavish spending:** The descriptions of his imaginary spending sprees, like the fifty-pound tip to his bedroom steward and the sixpenny cigar, are absurd and humorous.
* **Mr. Hills' character:** This lively and somewhat opportunistic character provides comic relief with his witty remarks and his constant pursuit of Bella.
* **The ending:**  Mr. Kemp's decision to stay and court Mrs. Bradshaw, while leaving half his money to Charlie Hills, is a wonderfully unexpected and hilarious twist.
* **The physical comedy:** Moments like Mr. Wright exploding harmlessly in front of the barber's shop and Mr. Kemp returning home in a cab after a night out with Mrs. Bradshaw add to the story's humorous tone.

**Irony:**

* **George Wright's plan backfires:** He tries to manipulate the situation for his own gain, but ultimately loses control and ends up in a worse position. The irony lies in the fact that the plan, intended to help him win Bella, actually jeopardizes his chances.
* **Mr. Kemp's unexpected success:** Despite his initial reluctance and forgetfulness, Mr. Kemp becomes quite successful in his role, even attracting the attention of Mrs. Bradshaw. The irony here is that the person least qualified for the job, turns out to be the most successful at it.
* **The characters' obliviousness:**  While the reader is privy to the truth, the characters remain unaware of the true nature of Mr. Kemp's wealth. This creates a situation where their reactions and decisions are often ironic, fueled by their ignorance.
* **The twist ending:** The final scene, where Mr. Kemp decides to stay and court Mrs. Bradshaw, is ironic because he has achieved the opposite of what he initially set out to do. It also serves as a poignant commentary on the fickle nature of love and the unpredictability of life.

Overall, "The Old Man of the Sea" is a comedic masterpiece filled with witty observations, charming characters, and a touch of irony. Jacobs masterfully uses humor and irony to create a hilarious and engaging story about love, money, and the unexpected turns life can take.

## Identify the author's tone and purpose in writing the story.
The author's tone in "The Old Man of the Sea" is primarily **humorous and satirical**.  Jacobs uses a lighthearted and whimsical approach to tell the story, often relying on witty dialogue and exaggerated situations to create amusement.  He mocks the characters' vanity, greed, and naivety, while also poking fun at societal expectations and the absurdity of some social interactions.

The story's **purpose** is to entertain, but it also carries a **satirical edge**, highlighting the flaws in human nature.  Jacobs uses the characters' pursuit of wealth and love as a springboard to explore themes of deception, manipulation, and the fickle nature of fortune.  He suggests that even when individuals strive for their dreams, their plans can be easily disrupted by unexpected events and their own inherent flaws.

Here are some specific examples to support this analysis:

* **Humorous tone:** The dialogue is often witty and playful, with characters using slang and engaging in humorous banter.  The old man's eccentric behavior and his blatant disregard for the truth contribute to the story's lighthearted tone.
* **Satirical edge:** The story mocks the social climbing aspirations of George Wright and the gullibility of those around him.  The old man's manipulation of everyone, including George, serves as a commentary on the power of deception and the potential for exploitation in pursuit of personal gain.
* **Exploration of flaws:** The characters are not portrayed as ideal individuals, but rather as flawed people driven by their desires.  Their weaknesses, such as greed, vanity, and gullibility, are exposed through their actions and reactions.
* **Unexpected twists and turns:** The story keeps the reader engaged with unexpected twists and turns.  These twists are often humorous, but also serve to underscore the unpredictability of life and the potential for things to unravel quickly.

Overall, "The Old Man of the Sea" is a comedic tale with a satirical bite. While entertaining, it also uses humor to expose the human condition and the complexities of social interactions, ultimately highlighting the irony of our pursuit of wealth and happiness.
