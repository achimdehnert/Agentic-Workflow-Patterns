George Wright's desire for Bella and his desire to use Mr. Kemp's wealth for social advancement are driven by his perception of Bella and her family as belonging to a higher social standing. The contrast between George's aspirations and Mr. Kemp's simple, easy-going nature underscores this class divide.

* **Irony:**  The story is filled with irony, as George's attempt to use Mr. Kemp's wealth to win Bella backfires and leads to his own humiliation and loss. Additionally, Mr. Kemp's innocent love for Mrs. Bradshaw ultimately leads to his own unexpected romantic entanglement.

## Dialogue Lines by Character in "The Old Man of the Sea"

**Mr. George Wright:**

* "What I want you to do," said Mr. George Wright, as he leaned towards the old sailor, "is to be an uncle to me."
* "A rich uncle," continued the young man, lowering his voice to prevent any keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge.  "An uncle from New Zealand, who is going to leave me all 'is money."
* "It ain't coming," was the reply.  "You've only got to say you've got it. Fact of the matter is, I've got my eye on a young lady; there's another chap after 'er too, and if she thought I'd got a rich uncle it might make all the difference.  She knows I 'ad an uncle that went to New Zealand and was never heard of since.  That's what made me think of it."
* "It don't matter," said the other.  "It'll only be for a little while, and then you'll 'ave a letter calling you back to New Zealand.  See?  And you'll go back, promising to come home in a year's time, after you've wound up your business, and leave us all your money.  See?"
* "I've only known you for about ten days," he concluded, "but I'd sooner trust you than people I've known for years."
* "This is my uncle," said Mr. Wright, speaking rapidly, "from New Zealand, the one I spoke to you about.  He turned up last night, and you might have knocked me down with a feather.  The last person in the world I expected to see."
* "He won't suffer for it, I'll be bound," said Mrs. Bradshaw, archly.
* "So far as money goes he won't," said the old man.  "Not that that would make any difference to George."
* "It would be the same to me if you hadn't got a farthing," said Mr. Wright, promptly.
* "Seems to be going all right," said Mr. Wright, as the old man made his report; "but be careful; don't go overdoing it."
* "Tell 'em of the money you have chucked about," said Mr. Wright.  "It'll do just as well, and come a good deal cheaper.  And you had better go round alone to-morrow evening.  It'll look better.  Just go in for another one of their sixpenny cigars."
* "It's wonderful how well they get on together," said Bella, as they re-entered the shop and passed into the parlour.  "I've never seen mother take to anybody so quick as she has to him."
* "I hope you like him, too," said Mr. Wright.
* "I suppose I shall know some day," said the young man, slowly; "but it won't be much good to me unless----"
* "Unless?"  said Bella, after a pause.
* "Unless it gives me what I want," replied the other.  "I'd sooner be a poor man and married to the girl I love, than a millionaire."
* "It's no good having diamonds and motor-cars and that sort of thing unless you have somebody to share them with," pursued Mr. Wright.
* "I'm all right," said Mr. Wright, with dignity, as the other hooked the door open with his stick and nodded at him.
* "Well, why don't you look it?"  demanded the lively Mr. Hills.  "Have you got your feet wet, or what?"
* "Oh, be quiet," said Miss Bradshaw, smiling at him.
* "Right-o," said Mr. Hills, dropping into a chair by the counter and caressing his moustache.  "But you wouldn't speak to me like that if you knew what a terrible day I've had."
* "He's just like what I was at his age," he said.  "Lively."
* "He's a man any woman might be happy with," said Mr. Hills.  "He never knows how much there is in his trousers-pocket.  Fancy sewing on buttons for a man like that.  Gold-mining ain't in it."
* "Draw it mild," interrupted the blushing Mr. Hills as Mr. Wright bestowed a ferocious glance upon the speaker.
* "Why didn't you tell 'em you had got a letter calling you home, as I told you?"  he vociferated, as soon as they were clear of the shop.
* "I--I forgot it," said the old man.
* "Forgot it!"  repeated the incensed Mr. Wright.
* "What did you think I was coughing like that for--fun?"
* "I forgot it," said the old man, doggedly.  "Besides, if you take my advice, you'd better let me stay a little longer to make sure of things."
* "I dare say," he said; "but I am managing this affair, not you.  Now, you go round to-morrow afternoon and tell them you're off.  D'ye hear?  D'ye think I'm made of money?  And what do you mean by making such a fuss of that fool, Charlie Hills?  You know he is after Bella."
* "To-morrow," said Mr. Wright, before the old man could reply. "Business."
* "Must you go," said Mrs. Bradshaw.
* "I suppose I ought to," he replied, in a hesitating voice.
* "He must go back," shouted the alarmed  Mr. Wright.
* "Let him speak for himself," exclaimed Bella, indignantly.
* "A week!" shouted Mr. Wright, almost beside himself with rage and dismay. "A week!  Another week!  Why, you told me----"
* "Oh, don't listen to him," said Mrs. Bradshaw.  "Croaker!  It's his own business, ain't it?  And he knows best, don't he?  What's it got to do with you?"
* "George!"  he said, suddenly.
* "Yes," said Mr. Wright, in a harsh voice.
* "Did you think to bring my pocket-book along with you?"
* "No," said Mr. Wright, sharply; "I didn't."
* "What--what--do you--want it for?"  he gasped.
* "And you can go and fetch a hansom-cab, George, while she's a-doing of it," said Mr. Kemp.  "Pick out a good 'orse--spotted-grey, if you can."
* "Thankee, my boy," said Mr. Kemp, bluffly, as he helped Mrs. Bradshaw in and stood with his foot on the step.  "By the way, you had better go back and lock my pocket-book up.  I left it on the washstand, and there's best part of a thousand pounds in it.  You can take fifty for yourself to buy smokes with."
* "I've got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don't want you to come with me.  I prefer to be alone.  You stay here and cheer them up.  Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o' pounds out o' that fifty I gave you last night.  I've given all my small change away."
* "You--you can't!" he gasped.
* "I'm going to have a try," said the old man.  "I'm sick of going to sea, and it'll be a nice comfortable home for my old age.  You marry Bella, and I'll marry her mother.  Happy family!"
* "And I'm to find you money to play the rich uncle with till you're married, I suppose," said Mr. Wright, in a grating voice, "and then lose Bella when Mrs. Bradshaw finds you've lost your money?"
* "That's your lookout," he said, at last.
* "Now, look here," said Mr. Wright, with great determination.  "Either you go and tell them that you've been telegraphed for--cabled is the proper word--or I tell them the truth."
* "That'll settle you then," said Mr. Kemp.
* "No more than the other would," retorted the young man, "and it'll come cheaper.  One thing I'll take my oath of, and that is I won't give you another farthing; but if you do as I tell you I'll give you a quid for luck.  Now, think it over."
* "He must go back," shouted the alarmed  Mr. Wright.
* "Let him speak for himself," exclaimed Bella, indignantly.
* "A week!" shouted Mr. Wright, almost beside himself with rage and dismay. "A week!  Another week!  Why, you told me----"
* "Oh, don't listen to him," said Mrs. Bradshaw.  "Croaker!  It's his own business, ain't it?  And he knows best, don't he?  What's it got to do with you?"
* "What--what--do you--want it for?"  he gasped.
* "We never know what may happen to us," said the old man, solemnly, as he rose and buttoned his coat.  "I'm an old man and I like to have things ship-shape.  I've spent nearly the whole day with my lawyer, and if anything 'appens to my old carcass it won't make any difference.  I have left half my money to George; half of all I have is to be his."
* "Good-bye, Georgie!"

**Mr. Kemp:**

* "Aye, aye," said the mystified Mr. Kemp, pausing with a mug of beer midway to his lips.
* "Where's it coming from?"  demanded Mr. Kemp, with a little excitement.
* "I've had money lent me before," he said, candidly, "but I can't call to mind ever paying it back.  I always meant to, but that's as far as it got."
* "I took a fancy to you the moment I set eyes on you," rejoined Mr. Kemp.  "You're the living image of a young fellow that lent me five pounds once, and was drowned afore my eyes the week after.  He 'ad a bit of a squint, and I s'pose that's how he came to fall overboard."
* "Good evening, miss; I hope you are well," and, subsiding into a chair, asked for a cigar.  His surprise when he found that the best cigar they stocked only cost sixpence almost assumed the dimensions of a grievance.
* "It'll do to go on with," he said, smelling it suspiciously.  "Have you got change for a fifty-pound note?"
* "So far as I know," he said, in reply to a question of Mrs. Bradshaw's, "George is the only relation I've got.  Him and me are quite alone, and I can tell you I was glad to find him."
* "It's not for long," said Mr. Kemp.  "I'm just going back for about a year to wind up things out there, and then I'm coming back to leave my old bones over here.  George has very kindly offered to let me live with him."
* "He's just going back for about a year to wind up things out there, and then he's coming back to leave his old bones over here.  George has very kindly offered to let him live with him." 
* "Mind," he said, as he walked home with the elated George, "it's your game, not mine, and it's sure to come a bit expensive.  I can't be a rich uncle without spending a bit.  'Ow much did you say you'd got in the bank?"
* "I can turn 'em round my little finger," he said.  "You'll have Bella all to yourself to-morrow evening."
* "I didn't do it," said Mr. Kemp, equably; "they done it.  The old lady says that, just for once in her life, she wants to see how it feels to spend money like water."
* "It don't matter to me," said Mr. Kemp.  "I can have a headache or a chill, or something of that sort, if you like.  I don't want to go.  It's no pleasure to me."
* "I'm not going back, never no more--never!  I'm going to stop here and court Mrs. Bradshaw."
* "I've thought it all out," said Mr. Kemp, nodding.  "She mustn't know I'm not rich till after we're married; then I 'ave a letter from New Zealand saying I've lost all my money.  It's just as easy to have that letter as the one you spoke of."
* "I'm going to have a try," said the old man.  "I'm sick of going to sea, and it'll be a nice comfortable home for my old age.  You marry Bella, and I'll marry her mother.  Happy family!"
* "I've got to catch the train for Southampton, but I don't want you to come with me.  I prefer to be alone.  You stay here and cheer them up.  Oh, and before I forget it, lend me a couple o' pounds out o' that fifty I gave you last night.  I've given all my small change away."
* "I'm an old man and I like to have things ship-shape.  I've spent nearly the whole day with my lawyer, and if anything 'appens to my old carcass it won't make any difference.  I have left half my money to George; half of all I have is to be his."

**Miss Bradshaw:**

* "Good evening," said the good-looking young woman who stood behind the counter: Mr. Kemp, adopting an air of scornful dignity intended to indicate the possession of great wealth, waited.
* "It'll do to go on with," he said, smelling it suspiciously.  "Have you got change for a fifty-pound note?"
* Miss Bradshaw, concealing her surprise by an effort, said that she would see, and was scanning the contents of a drawer, when Mr. Kemp in some haste discovered a few odd sovereigns in his waistcoat-pocket.
* "It's a pity you are so far apart," she said.
* "She's going to stay at home and mind the shop; it's the mother what's coming out.  Going to spend the evening with me!"
* "I've never seen mother take to anybody so quick as she has to him."
* "I wonder what it feels like?"
* "Oh, be quiet," said Miss Bradshaw, smiling at him.
* "Who to, pray?"  she inquired.
* "Me," said Mr. Hills, simply.  "I woke up in a cold perspiration. Halloa! is that Georgie in there?  How are you, George?  Better?"
* "He's a dear," said Bella.  "Fancy having all that money.  I wonder what it feels like?"
* "Always do," said the young man.  "That's why I can never get anybody to play with.  I had such an awful dream about you last night that I couldn't rest till I saw you.  Awful it was."
* "What was it?"  inquired Miss Bradshaw.
* "Dreamt you were married," said Mr. Hills, smiling at her.
* "I must go," said Mr. Kemp.  "I've spent over eleven pounds cabling to-day; but it's all no good."
* "But you're coming back?"  said Mr. Hills.
* "And there's you and Bella," continued Mr. Kemp; "two of the best that ever breathed."
* "Hear, hear!" said Mrs. Bradshaw, piously.

**Mrs. Bradshaw:**

* "It'll do to go on with," he said, smelling it suspiciously.  "Have you got change for a fifty-pound note?"
* "It's a pity you are so far apart," she said.
* "Seems to be going all right," said Mr. Wright, as the old man made his report; "but be careful; don't go overdoing it."
* "It's a pity you are so far apart," she said.
* "He's just going back for about a year to wind up things out there, and then he's coming back to leave his old bones over here.  George has very kindly offered to let him live with him." 
* "He's a man any woman might be happy with," said Mr. Hills.  "He never knows how much there is in his trousers-pocket.  Fancy sewing on buttons for a man like that.  Gold-mining ain't in it."
* "She's going to stay at home and mind the shop; it's the mother what's coming out.  Going to spend the evening with me!"
* "I've never seen mother take to anybody so quick as she has to him."
* "Well, well," said Mrs. Bradshaw, piously.
* "Take my tip and give yourself a bit of a holiday before you go back," urged Mr. Hills.
* "Just for a few days," pleaded Bella.
* "To please us," said Mrs. Bradshaw.  "Think 'ow George'll miss you."
* "Lay hold of him and don't let him go," said Mr. Hills.
* "We don't let you go till you promise," said Mrs. Bradshaw.
* "Well! Well!" seemed to sum up the general feeling; Mr. Kemp, shaking his head, eyed him with gentle reproach.
* "He must go back," shouted the alarmed  Mr. Wright.
* "Let him speak for himself," exclaimed Bella, indignantly.
* "Oh, don't listen to him," said Mrs. Bradshaw.  "Croaker!  It's his own business, ain't it?  And he knows best, don't he?  What's it got to do with you?"
* "Hear, hear!" said Mrs. Bradshaw, piously.

**Mr. Hills:**

* "Good evening," said the latter.  "I want a sixpenny smoke for twopence, please.  How are we this evening?  Sitting up and taking nourishment?"
* "Always do," said the young man.  "That's why I can never get anybody to play with.  I had such an awful dream about you last night that I couldn't rest till I saw you.  Awful it was."
* "What was it?"  inquired Miss Bradshaw.
* "Dreamt you were married," said Mr. Hills, smiling at her.
* "I woke up in a cold perspiration. Halloa! is that Georgie in there?  How are you, George?  Better?"
* "Right-o," said Mr. Hills, dropping into a chair by the counter and caressing his moustache.  "But you wouldn't speak to me like that if you knew what a terrible day I've had."
* "What have you been doing?"  asked the girl.
* "Working," said the other, with a huge sigh.  "Where's the millionaire? I came round on purpose to have a look at him."
* "Him and mother have gone to the Empire?"  said Miss Bradshaw.
* "He's just like what I was at his age," he said.  "Lively."
* "I'm not a patch on you," said Mr. Hills, edging his way by slow degrees into the parlour.  "I don't take young ladies to the Empire.  Were you telling me you came over here to get married, or did I dream it?"
* "'Ark at him," said the blushing Mr. Kemp, as Mrs. Bradshaw shook her head at the offender and told him to behave himself.
* "He's a man any woman might be happy with," said Mr. Hills.  "He never knows how much there is in his trousers-pocket.  Fancy sewing on buttons for a man like that.  Gold-mining ain't in it."
* "Take my tip and give yourself a bit of a holiday before you go back," urged Mr. Hills.
* "Just for a few days," pleaded Bella.
* "To please us," said Mrs. Bradshaw.  "Think 'ow George'll miss you."
* "Lay hold of him and don't let him go," said Mr. Hills.
* "But you're coming back?"  said Mr. Hills.
* "Draw it mild," interrupted the blushing Mr. Hills as Mr. Wright bestowed a ferocious glance upon the speaker.
* "Clever, lively young fellow," concluded Mr. Kemp.  "George!"

**Bella:**

* "I've never seen mother take to anybody so quick as she has to him."
* "I hope you like him, too," said Mr. Wright.
* "I suppose I shall know some day," said the young man, slowly; "but it won't be much good to me unless----"
* "Unless?"  said Bella, after a pause.
* "He's a dear," said Bella.  "Fancy having all that money.  I wonder what it feels like?"

* "He must go back," shouted the alarmed  Mr. Wright.
* "Let him speak for himself," exclaimed Bella, indignantly.

**Narrator:**

* "He ordered some more beer for Mr. Kemp, and in a low voice gave him as much of the family history as he considered necessary."
* "Fortunately for the latter's pocket the chest contained a good best suit and boots, and the only expenses incurred were for a large, soft felt hat and a gilded watch and chain."
* "He emptied his mug, and then, accompanied by Mr. Wright, fetched his sea-chest from the boarding-house where he was staying, and took it to the young man's lodgings."

## Irony and Humor in "The Old Man of the Sea"

W.W. Jacobs's "The Old Man of the Sea" is a humorous tale packed with irony, creating a chuckle-worthy situation where a simple scheme for romantic advancement turns into a chaotic mess. Here are some instances:

**Irony:**

* **The "Rich Uncle" Scheme:**  The initial premise of Mr. Wright's plan is ironic. He wants to create the illusion of a rich uncle to win Bella's affections, unaware that the scheme will backfire and lead to unintended consequences. 
* **Mr. Kemp's Transformation:**  The old sailor, Mr. Kemp, quickly adapts to the role of the rich uncle, relishing the attention and spending, despite having no actual wealth. The irony lies in his genuine enjoyment of playing the part and not the real riches.
* **Mr. Wright's Frustration:** Mr. Wright, driven by love and ambition, becomes a victim of his own creation. He finds himself trapped in a web of deceit, constantly having to supply funds to maintain the illusion.
* **Mrs. Bradshaw's Unexpected Transformation:**  Mrs. Bradshaw, initially skeptical of Mr. Kemp, embraces him as a rich uncle. The irony lies in her own desire for extravagance, making her a willing participant in the charade.
* **The "True" Identity of Mr. Kemp:**  Mr. Kemp, once a simple sailor, unexpectedly decides to become a permanent fixture in the Bradshaws' lives, revealing his true intentions to marry Mrs. Bradshaw. This sudden twist subverts the original scheme and creates a comedic climax.

**Humor:**

* **Mr. Kemp's Character:** The old sailor is a comedic figure, effortlessly switching between genuine seafaring mannerisms and the flamboyant persona of a rich uncle. His naivete and lack of self-awareness provide comedic relief.
* **Mr. Kemp's Spending:**  Mr. Kemp's exaggerated tales of lavish spending, his "mistaken" use of a sixpenny cigar, and his casual requests for large sums of money from Mr. Wright are humorous and highlight the absurdity of the situation.
* **Mr. Hills's Presence:** The lively Mr. Hills, constantly flirting with Bella and oblivious to the unfolding drama, serves as a comedic foil to the tension and frustration experienced by Mr. Wright. His persistent presence and lack of awareness add a humorous layer to the story.
* **Mr. Wright's Reactions:** Mr. Wright's increasingly frantic efforts to control the situation, his frustration, his inability to control Mr. Kemp, and his struggles to maintain appearances create comedic moments.
* **The Ending:** The final twist, where Mr. Kemp announces his intention to court Mrs. Bradshaw and his "generous" inheritance plans for Mr. Wright and Mr. Hills, leaves the reader laughing at the unexpected turn of events. 

**Overall, the humor in "The Old Man of the Sea" derives from the irony of the situation, the contrasting personalities of the characters, and the absurd consequences of a simple scheme.** The story, with its blend of irony and humor, creates a memorable and entertaining reading experience.
