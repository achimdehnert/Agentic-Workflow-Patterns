This error caused the pilot to show up about 30 minutes late. All in all Delta's inability to take care of this basic function resulted in about an hour delay. It was reported to the passengers that Delta failed to schedule the crew properly. This error caused the pilot to show up about 30 minutes late. All in all Delta's inability to take care of this basic function resulted in about an hour delay. Three adults, three children. They did not give us seats together. Two seats together, in row 23, one in 13, one in 14, one in 10, and one in 17. When we got on the plane, the crew tried to ask people to move but basically threw up their hands. One person moved so we had two pairs of seats together. The 1.5 year old sat on a parent's lap (despite having paid for his own seat). the fight attendants were great and i appreciated that they had season 1 of The Wire from HBO as a viewing option AC barely worked on a 50 minute flight. It was very warm the whole flight. Flight was very bumpy and hard landing. Meh. A late flight meant I missed my connections, and a 2pm LAX arrival turned into gettin in after midnight. Your crew could maybe answer the call bell at least one of the times I pressed it. I pressed it first time with 2.5 hours left in our flight bc my partner was hungry and wanted a sandwich. We finally got the sandwich with 40 mins left in the flight. The Flight crew didn’t serve us until about 1.5 hours into the flight because of turbulence but after it ended it was fine to move around. They served us water only and snacks and then NEVER, NOT ONE TIME came through to collect trash until right before landing about 1.5 hours later. There was absolutely no need for that. They crew was just standing around talking and visiting with each other and really never tried to see if we might want something besides water or even try to come pick up trash. This is VERY unusual for a Delta flight but it was not what I would have expected for a 4 hour flight. There was a loud squeaky sound the whole time we were flying. I didn’t like that I could not select my seat and was assigned a seat when I checked in at LAX Great experience overall. Check in at Austin was congested as they only have about 6 check in kiosks, one was broken, and there was a lot of Spring Break travelers. Traveling with JetBlue from NYC was convenient as accessing JFK airport was straightforward via the LIRR to the AirTrain. Maneuvering through the terminal was hassle-free, which was a pleasant start to the journey. However, the flight experience itself left much to be desired. The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable; despite securing a window seat, space felt cramped. This was exacerbated by the middle seat passenger encroaching on my area, which made the flight less enjoyable. Additionally, while the in-flight entertainment system initially seemed like a reprieve, the sound outlet on my seat was inoperable. This issue turned what could have been a manageable three-hour flight into a rather tedious ordeal, as I was unable to use the entertainment system effectively. While JetBlue provided a smooth process in terms of airport logistics, the on-board experience highlighted areas in need of improvement, particularly in terms of comfort and entertainment system maintenance. Over 2 hour delay for a 50-minute flight is unacceptable, especially in normal weather. Very poor communication via app The WiFi stopped working early on in the flight. No audio from entertainment system. The flight was excellent. The crew was welcoming and attentive. Going through JFK’s security is a mess. The TSA security said no shoes on the bins. So, we place our shoes in the belt and they came out all over the belt. Boarding was delayed and Flight as well. There were multiple delays but JetBlue tried to make the boarding and departure process as quick and efficient as possible. The crew was as detached from reality as could be, meaning: not very friendly and just doing things by the numbers. 40 minute delay before take off after boarding flight. Bright lights throughout night flight due Issues with light panels. In flight Entertainment nonfunctional Another horrible Jet Blue experience. This airline has suffered the biggest decline of all from best to worst. TVs didn’t work (again). internet was temperamental. Boarded late and couldn’t get organized to serve snacks. I hate their constant delays! It’s as if I cannot confidently make plans for timing when I'm traveling with them. I slept through it, so all I can say is it was good. There was no wheelchair or wheelchair escort at the gate..unacceptable Lufthansa and United Airlines messed up with our reservation and they canceled our flight to Los Angeles. We ended up stuck in Frankfurt with two little kids. They sent us to San Francisco, but their flight was full and they wanted us to sit separated (even our 3-year-old was supposed to sit separated from me or my husband!!! Isn't it illegal???). Then the flight from San Francisco was delayed and we had two little sleepy kids, we were also told we needed to pick up our luggages. It was just horrible. I paid for a direct flight from Frankfurt to LAX and ended up going through hell. I am very upset and going to submit a complaint. See my previous comments. I was probably booked in business but was moved to economy Boarding was efficient. Crew was not pleasant and skipped me during a round of beverage service. Older plane with no seat back screens and I couldn’t connect to wifi or their entertainment offerings. My flight was delayed for a whole day, so I lost a day of my vacation. Ability to watch movies.No earbud sound system.Marginal beverage service.Unexplained late take off resulting in VERY tight connection in LA which proved maximally stressful. Ability to watch movies.No earbud sound system.Marginal beverage service. Flighty delayed on boarding - then group 1 had to check their carry on bags but groups 3 and beyond could carry bags on - very inconvenient for weekend business trip with no checked baggage. Then delayed on the runway - before take off. No communication from pilot on why or how long. Wifi/Entertainment didn't work for 4+ flight. Upon arrival, attendants announced wrong carousel for baggage claim - everyone was waiting at the wrong place for their checked bags. This was a mess united! Check in etc was very good. As for on the plane, it was like flying in a freezer. It was so cold, i have flown for years and never been so cold on a plane. Staff on board said its always cold when flying which is a load of rubbish. They wouldnt put any heating on and now i have the flu because of this . Our original business class flight was cancelled so we not only downgraded but we were also spread out across the plane not sitting together in separate middle seats. My poor kids were scared and couldn’t see me on the flight and the crew wasn’t sensitive to the situation and what the airlines did to us. Very dissatisfied with United airlines. The WiFi didn’t work and the seats are too close together. Very uncomfortable. I was unhappy with having the seat I chose changed at the last minute. I was moved to an aisle seat which did not recline and was next to the bathroom. The bathroom odors made the flight entirely unpleasant. Having carefully chosen my seat months before I was not pleased with my AA experience. In addition, they ran out of tea during flight service, really? The aircraft was on-time and plane and lavatory was clean. My husband and I pre-ordered our food, but they did not have my husband’s order, and my cheese plate was very average. I asked for a blanket and was told they don’t carry blankets on domestic routs. The flight was on time and smooth! There were delays on both ends. It made it less than excellent. This plane was great though Fight crew was not very attentive and the bastions were gross! Our flight was great we left Kona earlier and got into LAX almost an 1hour earlier as well. LAX AA is in repair so to get out and found our bus to get pick up was a bit confusing. 5 hour flight - full flight - not enough room to use my computer - slightly delayed - Admirals club was excellent quality food, drink made up for flight seating. No food offerred on flight, you ahd to prebook. We experience delays on departure and connecting flights resulting in 14 hour to our next departure. We were accommodated with a night's stay but was only provided a 12 dollar meals accommodation. The airlines rules state.at least 50 dollars. In any case, it can not make up for the whole day missed on our vacation in Sydney Australia. I can say I will not be taking this airline again any time soon. Seat were uncomfortable and too tight. Lack of chair screen and little overhead space. Poor availability of food. Cold cabin temperature. Extremely long waiting time for a flight attendant to respond to a call button signal. Better overall experience from my first flight with Spirit several years ago. Efficient boarding (albeit I arrived after all rows were called) and flight actually left earlier than planned. I am still baffled by being charged for everything, even a non-alcoholic beverage. And there is definitely less seat room which makes a flight that’s more than 2 hours really uncomfortable. Would have been better if I would’ve made it on my flight but it was delayed twice and then canceled and now I’m stuck till Monday which was and extra 5 days I did not count on . Awful. My flight was three hours late leaving DFW and we just arrived at LAX three hours late and stuck on the runway. I heard the Spirit workers at the desk in DFW say that we were waiting on a crew. I am extremely disappointed in Spirit. Terrible airline. Cancelled the flight less than 24 hours before the flight. Caused me extra expenses!!! This will be the last time me and my family will travel with them Very uncomfortable seats that do not recline. My husband had hip replacement 7 years ago; after 5 hours from Maryland to California and another 5 hours back, we had to go to the emergency for the intense pain on his hip joint and soon he will see the surgeon. The cherry on the cake was when at the end of our flight back to BWI, we were prompted by a flight attendant to stretch: "arms right, now left, now reach your toes..." (really? how can we do that as we are sitting on seats with no leg room?) "...and as you are there, pick up any garbage you may see on the floor"!!! wow! Both flights were delayed. Flight from LGA to DTW caused serious anxiety as 3 people were removed from the aircraft before take off for disorderly conduct. Extremely uncomfortable to be in that situation. Staff handled themselves okay- definitely could’ve been more professional and deescalated the situation first. No apology for the delays at all. No water, no snack, no nothing. Not a good flight experience. Cancelled the return flight moments before boarding, horrible customer service in assisting with any rebooking. Never again will I fly Spirit. The flight was minimally delayed and after landing we needed to wait an hour, hungry, thirsty, and with other customers improper behavior. Flight was good and quick, boarding was delayed but quick. Thanks Terrible leg room, seats don’t recline, delayed flight, and even water isn’t free onboard It was nice! There was a very unhappy child in front of us and the flight attendant did a great job calming the child. I was impressed.

Flying economy class can also be a more environmentally efficient way of flying since it’s more space efficient than traveling in business or first class.
