Learn more Justine Harrington, Contributor Forbes Vetted In a city the size of Houston—the country’s fourth-largest—it’s no surprise to find a hotel scene chock full of variety. After all, this sprawling metropolis is home to award-winning global cuisine, world-class museums, outdoor activities and plenty of sports teams to please every type of traveler. The best hotels in Houston range from glamorous stays perfect for quiet luxury, cozy boutique experiences, wellness-focused properties with indulgent spa offerings and affordable-but-hip lodging. Houston’s diverse patchwork of neighborhoods is brimming with top-notch hotels that prize Texas hospitality above all else. Artsy Montrose is where to go for cool, eclectic properties like La Colombe d’Or, while Downtown has its fair share of upscale hotels with modern amenities, like the JW Marriott Houston and the Four Seasons Houston. Midtown is home to charming boutiques like La Maison In Midtown, while Uptown is home to the city’s best spa at The Post Oak Hotel. Below, the best hotels in Houston in 2024. Best High-End Hotel In Houston: La Colombe d’Or There’s nowhere else in town like this historic property, which boasts a sizable private art collection, a sculpture garden and fine dining. La Colombe d’Or Right in the heart of Montrose, La Colombe d’Or is a boutique destination unto itself. There’s nowhere else in town like this historic property, which boasts a sizable private art collection, a sculpture garden, a park and creative cocktails and fine dining from renowned eatery Tonight & Tomorrow. Guests have their pick of three unique stay experiences that include the original 1920s mansion, a set of secluded garden bungalows and a recently built luxury tower. The hotel’s programming is also excellent, with bespoke fitness classes, private wine dinners, art tours and other ongoing events. Interior design and art nerds will have a field day marveling over the original artworks displayed on the walls and in the gardens (including paintings by Dorothy Hood and Lucas Johnson, a Picasso lithograph and a marble statue by Pasquale Romanelli) as well as the gorgeous textiles and furnishings used throughout the space. It’s like a little slice of Europe in the middle of Houston. Best Boutique Hotel In Houston: La Maison In Midtown The seven rooms are outfitted with charming decor and luxury amenities like spa tubs and sumptuous bedding. La Maison In Midtown Prepare to feel more like you’re staying at a close friend or family member’s home rather than checking into a hotel when you spend the night at La Maison in Midtown. Owners Sharon Owens and Genora Boykins run this intimate bed-and-breakfast with highly personalized love and care. There are just seven rooms, all of which are outfitted with charming decor and luxury amenities like spa tubs, oversized showers and sumptuous bedding. The communal areas (a parlor, living room and dining area) are cozy and inviting, and the sunny conference room fits 12. Best of all, there’s an “urban high tea” with wine and cheese held in the afternoons, and a hearty full breakfast served every morning in the French-style kitchen. La Maison in Midtown also makes for a great basecamp for exploring some of the best local attractions in downtown Houston, like the Museum District and Discovery Green. Best Value Hotel In Houston: Aloft Houston By The Galleria The hotel is located in the city’s Uptown District, home to the famous Galleria Mall and a slew of other retailers and fine dining. Aloft Houston By The Galleria Travelers who want to save some cash without sacrificing comfort or being in a good location would do well to book a stay at the Aloft Houston by the Galleria. The hotel is located in the city’s Uptown District, home to the famous Galleria Mall (Texas’ largest, with over 375 stores, an ice rink and near-endless dining options) and a slew of other retailers and fine dining. There are plenty of amenities here to keep guests satisfied, including a sleek pool, complimentary Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and supremely comfortable beds. The WXYZ Bar is a great place to mingle and sip cocktails, as is the Remix lounge. Grab a snack from re:fuel, a self-serve gourmet eatery that’s open 24/7 and has make-your-own cappuccinos. The price is very right for this well-appointed hotel, which, in addition to the Galleria, is also situated near Memorial Park and other attractions. Best Hotel For Families In Houston: The Houstonian Hotel The Houstonian's exclusive health and fitness club includes custom programs for children and an incredible full-service spa. The Houstonian Hotel Considering the sheer amount of amenities and services available at The Houstonian Hotel, it’s easy to never leave the premises, making it the perfect lodging choice for families with small kiddos who’d prefer to have everything at their fingertips rather than try to wrangle everyone around town. The Houstonian is perhaps best known for its exclusive health and fitness club, a 185,000-square-foot space offering 180 group exercise classes per week (including custom programs for children as well as aquatics, tennis, yoga, Pilates and more for adults), and its incredible full-service spa. The hotel pools will keep everyone happy for hours—there are three of them, including a Resort Pool (featuring a rock slide, a “Little Lagoon” children’s pool and a Jacuzzi), a Sports Pool and an adults-only Garden Pool. When hunger pangs strike, you’ll have several options to pick from, ranging from light bar food to seasonally curated Tex-Mex and Southern fare. Not to mention, the hotel’s location adjacent to Memorial Park lends itself well to outdoor activity. The sprawling grounds are lush and wooded, and there’s an on-site trail that feeds into Memorial Park’s longer trails. Best Hotel For Couples In Houston: Hotel ZaZa Houston Museum District Make time for a soak in the stylish pool and a feast at on-site eatery Monarch, where the terrace offers awesome views. Hotel ZaZa Houston Museum District From the moment you check in until the second you leave, you and your sweetheart will enjoy a delightful experience on every level at Hotel ZaZa Houston in the Museum District. Rooms and suites here are uniquely appointed with luxury fabrics, antique furniture and top-of-the-line linens. Each embodies a concept, like the Geisha House, which is furnished with Japanese-inspired decor, and the Villa Champagne, a bohemian-style apartment with European flair. Aside from cozying up in your room, make time for a soak in the stylish pool and a feast at on-site eatery Monarch, where the terrace offers awesome views of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Mecom Fountain. Round out your stay with the “Two’s a Party” package, which includes a custom couple’s massage (with multiple modalities to choose from, like Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone). Hotel ZaZa also offers a variety of other service packages, all perfectly suited for couples. Hotel With The Best Pools In Houston: Marriott Marquis Houston Pools at Marriott Marquis Houston. Marriott Marquis Houston Nothing says Texas summer quite like taking a dip in the “world’s largest Texas-shaped rooftop lazy river,” as the Marriott Marquis Houston claims to have. This lazy river (attached to an outdoor pool) is open year-round, and it’s a mighty prime spot to be when Houston’s sweltering temperatures take over the city. Other amenities here include a state-of-the-art spa and fitness center (complete with personal training sessions) and more than 150,000 square feet of event space (ballrooms, meeting rooms and a rooftop terrace and pavilion). The wealth of on-site cuisine ranges from Gulf Coast homestyle meals to traditional Oaxacan food with a Texas twist, and on-site bar Cueva offers a fantastic selection of premium wines, liquors and craft cocktails. Accommodations are spacious and comfortable, with crisp white linens, ergonomic chairs and desks and modern amenities. At the M Club, Marriott members can take advantage of complimentary snacks and nonalcoholic beverages, private workspaces, and panoramic views of the downtown skyline. Best Hotel For Business Travelers In Houston: JW Marriott Houston Downtown The versatile meeting and event space includes a ballroom and eight meeting rooms equipped with cutting-edge audiovisual technology. JW Marriott Houston Downtown There are many reasons for business travelers to love the JW Marriott Downtown. For starters, there’s the hotel’s ultra-convenient location, near Minute Maid Park, the George R. Brown Convention Center and other downtown spots. The whopping 13,500 square feet of versatile meeting and event space includes a super-spacious ballroom and eight meeting rooms, all of which come equipped with cutting-edge audiovisual technology. The on-site spa is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of meetings—treat yourself to a soothing massage, facial or body scrub—or get an endorphin-boosting workout in at the fitness center, which has an array of cardio equipment, ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines and more. And guests will never have to go far for a good meal or drink: indulge in a post-work cocktail or glass of wine at the 806 Lounge before tucking into dinner at Main Kitchen. All rooms have Nespresso machines, free Wi-Fi and an iPad for ordering room service and booking spa treatments. Best Hotel For Foodies In Houston: The Lancaster Hotel Dining at The Lancaster. The Lancaster Hotel The Lancaster Hotel’s on-site restaurant, Cultivated F+B, is decidedly better than many hotel restaurants in H-Town. Billed as “contemporary American fine dining,” the menu here features elegant dinner entrées like braised boneless short ribs, pan-seared scallops, shrimp scampi and seared pork ribeye. They also do a great brunch, with dishes like braised ribs Benedict, West Coast huevos rancheros and make-your-own omelets. Aside from the food, the Lancaster stands out for its stately, historic building—the hotel is listed as a Texas Historical Landmark and a Historic Hotel of America—and luxuriously appointed rooms that all have original artwork, complimentary snacks and beverages, Frette bedding, Bulgari bath products and Carrara marble in the bathrooms. There’s also a daily afternoon tea service with a three-course menu of tea sandwiches, pastries and a curated selection of fine teas. Best Hotel For Spa And Wellness In Houston: The Post Oak Hotel At Uptown Houston Women's vitality pool at The Post Oak Hotel At Uptown Houston. The Post Oak Hotel At Uptown Houston The Post Oak at Uptown Houston exudes pure luxury and boasts all manner of sophisticated amenities and services. Most notably, the full-service spa found here is life-changingly good. Soak in a tranquility pool, relax in the aroma steam room and boost circulation in the high-tech sauna, along with indulging in your facial or body treatment of choice. On-site restaurant Bloom & Bee is a standout with its fresh, locally sourced fare, but there are a number of other dining options here to suit every palate. Other signature amenities include a sleekly appointed pool with private cabanas, chaise lounges and fire pits, along with a concierge lounge with sweeping views of downtown, a multimillion-dollar art collection and the Cellar, a well-rounded wine reserve with prestigious wines from all over the world. Hotel With The Best Amenities In Houston: Four Seasons Hotel Houston Lobby at Four Seasons Hotel Houston. Four Seasons Hotel Houston Lavish and homey at once, the Four Seasons Houston covers all the bases and then some. With a fabulous spa, a sparkling rooftop pool, a myriad of delectable eateries, a 24/7 fitness center and on-site activities the whole family will enjoy (think movies by the pool to live music to mommy-and-me yoga classes), there’s simply no stone unturned when it comes to keeping guests happy. As you might imagine, rooms here are sumptuously decorated and equipped with exclusive amenities that include sublimely comfy bedding, plush slippers with bathrobes, Diptyque bath products, well-stocked private bars, Nespresso machines and custom-designed interiors (to name a few). For the ultimate in entertainment, book a Topgolf Swing Suite, which offers an immersive virtual golf experience. The hotel’s concierge is also exceptionally personable and helpful and can help arrange car services, limo services and airport transfers.

North AmericaChevron United StatesChevron TexasChevron HoustonChevron 11 Best Hotels in Houston All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase something through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Whether you find yourself in Houston for business or pleasure, the city serves its visitors a sophisticated selection of places to retreat after full day on the go. And if you find yourself flustered on where to even begin your search, might we suggest location as a tried-and-true starting point? Each pocket of The Space City has its own personality that has been shaped by these hotels—la of which offer experiences and amenities that can help boost your stay. From the hottest new properties in downtown Houston, to proximity to the home of the Astros, to hip areas like Montrose, read on for our list of where to stay in Houston. The Moran CityCentreArrow If you need a good place to stay in the Energy Corridor, you won't be let down by The Moran, which offers modern rooms in a buzzy location near shops, dining, and entertainment (it's right by Memorial City's CityCentre Plaza). We stayed in a Classic King room, which had views of the Energy Corridor. The Monnalisa bar has live music, and a third-floor floor is a nice little respite from the comings and goings at street level. The Houstonian Hotel, Club & SpaArrow The Houstonian, a welcome reprieve from urban life, is not a place one stumbles upon just by happenstance; rather, you're probably here for a wedding or huge family event. The sprawling grounds, which are lush with beautiful botanicals, have amenities galore, including a number of pools—a sports pool, a resort pool, a garden pool—as well as a 175,000-square-foot health and fitness club offering everything from tennis to Pilates. Four Seasons Hotel HoustonArrow Walking into the Four Seasons is like stepping into an exclusive club that has been around for ages. The interior—all marble and mahogany—manages to straddle the line between Texas traditional and contemporary. The newly renovated gym is open 24 hours a day, and the hotel is kid-friendly to the umpteenth degree, with activities like mommy-and-me yoga, movies by the pool, and pizza-making class. The hotel occupies a prime central location downtown, just steps from the convention center, which means it gets its fair of share of business travelers, and for good reason: With its stellar staff, amenities, and accommodations, the Four Seasons is second to none in the The Bayou City. Lancaster HotelArrow There's been a lot of buzz surrounding the multi-million dollar renovation of The Lancaster, a historic hotel that enjoys a great location in the heart of the Houston Theater District. Fresh off a renovation that ended in fall 2019, the 93 guest rooms and suites boast luxurious touches like Carrara marble and upscale finishes, along with Bulgari toiletries and Fretté linens. There's a new focus on contemporary art, with each room featuring a unique piece, as well as a new on-site restaurant. Hotel ZaZa Houston Museum DistrictArrow Hotel ZaZa, which is around the corner from the Houston Museum of Fine Art, is a sophisticated, yet sexy, place where business and leisure coexist. The Houston We Have a Problem suite, one of ZaZa's so-called Concept Suites, goes all in on the theme with a moon-inspired couch and a life-size astronaut statue presiding over one corner. The space is huge—more than 1,000 square feet—with a large, executive-style table that seats as many as eight people. An extensive poolside menu offers adult popsicles and drinks by the pitcher; the fitness machines have individual TVs (hallelujah), and the Have No Mercy deep-tissue massage at ZaSpa is to die for. The restaurant, meanwhile, draws a mix of locals and hotel guests; its terrace has good views of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Mecom Foundation. Hotel ZaZa Houston Memorial CityArrow If you find the check-in process at the Memorial City location of Hotel ZaZa to be a blur, no one could possibly blame you; after all, who wouldn't want to rush to get upstairs to the posh pool? It's like a slice of Palm Springs in Houston. We splurged on the French Connection Suite, one of the themed Magnificent Seven Suites, which boasts sexy decor, marble accents in the bathroom, and a cozy balcony and sitting area. The poodle statue next to the toilet is a whimsical touch. The St. Regis HoustonArrow Located in between the prestigious River Oaks neighborhood and The Galleria, the luxurious St. Regis looks a bit like a glamorous high-rise condominium. Junior suites have a separate sleeping area and floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the pool and River Oaks. The king-size beds have a pillow top, and the bathrooms are outfitted in granite and marble—another reminder that no, this isn't your typical Houston hotel. Note, also, that Afternoon Tea is a storied tradition at The St. Regis, no matter the location. Hotel Granduca HoustonArrow From the moment you step foot into the Granduca in Uptown Park, you'll feel like you're staying in an Italian villa. The decor feels like it's been lifted from a B&B in Tuscany; one junior suite had a spacious floor plan with a living room, dining room, bedroom, and bathroom with a very large walk-in shower. An enchanting pool is an ideal perch for happy hour (try The 1080, the hotel's signature cocktail), and there's also a great Afternoon Tea. JW Marriott Houston DowntownArrow Located in one of the buzziest business districts in Houston, the JW Marriott attracts an elite group of business travelers seeking top-notch service and amenities without the fuss that are sometimes associated with boutique hotels. Rooms are impressively sleek and spacious; amenities include free wifi, an iPad for ordering room service or book spa treatments, and Nespresso machines; and The Spa by JW offers an array of interesting treatments, including foot soaks, massages, and facials. The Post Oak Hotel at Uptown HoustonArrow This is the most expensive hotel in Houston and that's something that you notice. The Post Oak's billionaire owner Tilman Fertitta spared nothing here. He believes, for example, that a great hotel needs great art, so he put large works on display throughout (he's particularly fond of the Frank Stella in the entry). But it's not luxury for luxury's sake. "Luxury equals convenience," says Fertitta. "The design [here] is for the customer." Whether you're considering shaving your legs in the bathtub, looking to workout in your room or just really in need of a comfortable seat for watching TV, it's all been considered. And the 20,000-square-foot urban spa on the hotel’s fifth floor is absolutely a thing of beauty.

These 100 Hotels Were Voted Best in the World by T+L Readers — and 16 of Them Are in the U.S. Hotels in Asia, India, and the United States got the most attention from T+L readers in the annual “World’s Best Awards” survey for 2024. Paul Brady is the news director at Travel + Leisure and the brand's expert on cruise travel. He has been covering the travel industry for more than 15 years for outlets including Condé Nast Traveler, Skift, and The Huffington Post. Travel + Leisure readers are going global. In this year’s World’s Best Awards, readers’ favorite hotels span far and wide, with 38 countries making an appearance on the 2024 list. Properties in destinations like India and Southeast Asia are among the highest scorers this year, along with 16 stellar U.S. properties. At each hotel, voters were wowed by the style and the service of the top 100: Every winner scored higher than 97 on our 100-point survey. Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts How Voting Works Every year for our World's Best Awards survey, T+L asks readers to weigh in on travel experiences around the globe — to share their opinions on the top hotels, resorts, cities, islands, cruise ships, spas, airlines, and more. Over 186,000 T+L readers completed the 2024 survey. A total of more than 700,000 votes were cast across over 8,700 properties (hotels, cities, cruise lines, etc.). Hotels were classified as either resort hotel, city hotel, inn, or safari lodge based on their location and amenities, and they were specifically rated on the criteria below: For each characteristic, respondents could choose a rating of excellent, above average, average, below average, or poor. The final scores are averages of these responses. What Readers Loved T+L readers traveled off the beaten path this past year. Each of the top 10 properties is located in a different country, from Spain to Qatar to Mexico. In Europe, England had four properties in the top 100, while France, Italy, and Spain each had two. Thirteen safari lodges and resorts caught our readers’ attention in Kenya, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The highlights of some of these stays? Readers mentioned chimpanzee tracking, private game drives, and accommodations so close to the action, they could hear the animals. Those craving a calmer getaway found what they were looking for in villas next to white-sand beaches and crystal blue seas. The Maldives and the Indonesian island of Bali were particularly popular, with four and six hotels, respectively, in the top 100. While each winning property has its own allure — from an underwater restaurant at one property to pro surfers-turned-coaches at another — all these escapes offered voters the satisfaction of pure isolation without skimping on service. For all the international adventure, T+L readers spent time exploring the United States, too, which has 16 properties on this year’s list. California has the most properties in the U.S. in the top 100, with four seaside hotels in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Newport Beach, Oceanside, and Sausalito. And the East Coast received some love, in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, and South Carolina. Below, find a full rundown of the top 100 hotels in the world, as voted by T+L readers. The Full List 1. The Oberoi Rajvilas, Jaipur: Jaipur, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts Maybe it’s the peacocks that roam the grounds, or maybe it’s the sumptuous rooms — many with private gardens and plunge pools — that put this luxurious retreat over the top. Readers simply can’t get enough of this world-class hotel in one of India’s most alluring cities. “Truly magical — a beautiful property and a very serene oasis,” said one voter. “An amazing experience,” agreed another. The impeccably manicured gardens play host to morning yoga classes, while there’s a full lineup of treatments at the guests-only spa. The most enticing element of a stay, though, may be the sense of calm with which the staff of the Oberoi Rajvilas carry themselves — and pass on to their appreciative guests. Reader Score: 99.79 2. La Casa de la Playa: Playa del Carmen, Mexico Courtesy of La Casa de la Playa A close second in reader voting, this Playa del Carmen hideaway is a 63-room boutique hotel that feels super-exclusive while also offering access to all the amenities of the Grupo Xcaret development. Experiences on- and off-property are all handled by the in-house team; a Virgilio Martinéz restaurant is a particular dining highlight. Reader Score: 99.76 3. The Ritz-Carlton, Doha: Doha, Qatar Courtesy of The RItz-Carlton, Doha Hidden away on a small, exclusive island near the city’s Pearl Island development, this family-friendly five-star has what one voter calls “some of the best service and facilities in Qatar,” including several restaurants, pools, views of Persian Gulf, and a private beach. The fitness facilities — including racquet-sports courts — wowed voters, too. Reader Score: 99.64 4. Park Hyatt Siem Reap: Siem Reap, Cambodia Courtesy of Park Hyatt Siem Reap A legendary luxury property designed by the prolific Bill Bensley, the Park Hyatt is a richly appointed option on the way to Angkor Wat. “Lovely and authentic hospitality, consistent service, and friendly staff, with excellent food,” said one reader, who also appreciated the property’s two swimming pools. Reader Score: 99.40 5. Selman Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of Selman Marrakech A Marrakesh classic, the Selman is famous for its collection of Arabian horses, which occasionally parade around the gardens to the delight of guests. But the Jacques Garcia–designed resort is anything but a one-trick pony: its 60 rooms, suites, and villas are some of the city’s most glamorous, and a Chenot spa has almost every biohacking treatment imaginable. Reader Score: 99.39 6. Gran Hotel Mas d'en Bruno: Torroja del Priorat, Spain Courtesy of Gran Hotel Mas d'en Bruno Opened in 2023 in the burgeoning Spanish wine region of Priorat, this new Relais & Châteaux retreat with just 24 rooms has major culinary ambitions at its main restaurant, Vinum. “They are making amazing meals, with the best products the region has to offer, without being pretentious,” said one voter, who also raved about the “beautiful views and utter peace and quiet” at the hotel. Reader Score: 99.33 7. Regent Hong Kong: Hong Kong, China Courtrsy of Regent Hong Kong A new global flagship for the refreshed Regent brand, this 497-room Hong Kong hotel was years in the making. The wait, voters said, was worth it for this luxurious perch along the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade. The seven on-site restaurants, including the two Michelin star Lai Ching Heen, also impressed readers. Reader Score: 99.33 8. Pendry Newport Beach: Newport Beach, California Courtesy of Pendry Newport Beach Opened last fall with a celebrity-filled party, this property marks the third in Southern California for Pendry, a brand that prides itself on exceptional service in boutique spaces. The 20-story hotel has injected new life into the Newport Beach social scene with a private members' club, a swanky lounge with live music, and several luxe dining options. Reader Score: 99.29 9. (tie) Alma Resort: Cam Ranh, Vietnam Courtesy of Alma Resort Oceanfront Alma, on the Cam Ranh Peninsula just south of Nha Trang, Vietnam, is a full-featured beach resort with 12 pools, 14 restaurants and bars, plenty of kid-friendly activities, a spacious spa — and even an on-property farm from which many ingredients are sourced. Reader Score: 99.20 9. (tie) Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi: South Malé Atoll, Maldives Athul Prasad The top-scoring Maldives property on this year’s list, the Waldorf Astoria is a study in maximalist luxury. “It was an unforgettable experience,” said one respondent, summing up the vibe among voters. While the main resort has plenty to offer, the most eye-catching feature of the Waldorf Astoria may be its private island, an exclusive escape with room for up to 24 guests — and a nightly price tag approaching six figures. Reader Score: 99.20 11. Mission Pacific Beach Resort: Oceanside, California Courtesy of Mission Pacific Beach Resort Winning in three separate categories this year, including No. 1 for best California resort and continental U.S. resort, respectively, this beachside property is more than just California cool. It features private balconies with beach views, a Michelin-starred restaurant, and the original bungalow featured in Top Gun. Reader Score: 99.17 12. Argos in Cappadocia: Turkey, Cappadocia Courtesy of Argos in Cappadocia While new to the World’s Best Awards, this site is anything but, as it’s located in one of the oldest and largest monasteries in the world, built from traditional Turkish stones, wood, and handicrafts. Taste “food beyond imagination,” according to one reader, at on-site Nahita (or sip from one of the cellar’s 70,000 bottles), get a massage overlooking Mount Erciyes and Pigeon Valley, or explore centuries-old underground tunnels beneath the hotel, too. Reader Score: 99.09 12. Capella Ubud: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of Capella Ubud, Bali It’s been described as “a tropical fever dream of tented suites,” a place that was, in 2020, named the best hotel in the world by T+L readers. These days, it remains a highly regarded resort, thanks to its secluded setting in the upland forests near the town of Ubud and enchanting, antiques-filled spaces that feel like nothing else in the world. Reader Score: 99.09 14. Raffles The Palm Dubai: Dubai, United Arab Emirates Courtesy of Raffles The Palm Dubai In signature Raffles fashion, this property from the luxe hotel brand — its first in the Middle East — brings extravagant amenities and glamor to already-bustling Dubai. Take its 6,000 Swarovski Crystal chandeliers or the 80-seat private movie theater on property. And the brand’s acclaimed 24-hour personalized butler service is a highlight for guests, too. Reader Score: 99.08 15. Six Senses Fort Barwara: Rajasthan, India Aparna Jayakumar “A dazzling concoction of new and old,” this stunning palace hotel, which appeared on the May 2022 cover of T+L, occupies some buildings that date back 700 years, not far from India’s Ranthambore National Park. Now part of wellness-oriented Six Senses, the 48-suite resort has a 30,000-square-foot spa and an Ayurvedic practitioner on call. Reader Score: 99.06 16. The Winnetu Oceanside Resort: Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts Courtesy of The Winnetu Oceanside Resort This family-owned property on Martha’s Vineyard gets attention for its “great location” — spanning 11 acres of private beach — outstanding family programming, and menu options at The Dunes restaurant, according to our readers. So it’s no wonder that it took the No. 1 spot on our Best New England Resorts list this year. Reader Score: 99.00 17. Anantara Kihavah Maldives Resort: Baa Atoll, Maldives Courtesy of Minor Hotels A collection of 80 villas and multi-bedroom “residences,” the only Anantara resort to make this list distinguishes itself with an impressive array of activities and amenities, including an underwater restaurant, a celestial observatory, and a kids’ club. Reader Score: 98.95 18. La Mamounia Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of La Mamounia Marrakech The legendary hotel recently celebrated 100 years, and its next century is looking bright, thanks to a recent refurb that spruced up public spaces while adding a 20-seat cinema, a semi-secret wine bar, and a South Asian restaurant from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Reader Score: 98.94 19. Tierra Atacama: San Pedro de Atacama, Chile Courtesy of Tierra Atacama One of the three lodges operated by Chile-based Tierra Hotels, this intimate all-inclusive in the heart of the country’s northern desert is a go-to for stargazers, bird watchers, and adventurers. While this hotel is currently under renovation as of April 1, 2024, you can make a reservation now for March 2025 and beyond. Reader Score: 98.93 20. The Mulia: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The Mulia This beachfront, idyllic escape in the Nusa Dua resort area is a perfect combination “ of luxury and relaxation,” according to one reader. From private butler services to suites with Jacuzzi-equipped balconies, the Mulia ensures first-class service worth talking about when you return home. Reader Score: 98.92 21. Monwana Game Lodge: Thornybush Nature Reserve, South Africa Courtesy of MORE Family Collection Home to the Big Five in Greater Kruger National Park, this property is described by one reader as “an oasis in the bush.” From the intimate, six spacious suites to private butler service and a dedicated game-viewing team, it’s no wonder Monwana also took home the No. 1 spot for our readers’ favorite Africa safari lodges. Reader Score: 98.90 22. Joali Maldives: Raa Atoll, Maldives Courtesy of JOALI A soulful resort with a particular focus on the arts, this 73-villa resort has site-specific works, interactive exhibits, studio classes, and a gorgeous boutique — as well as all the traditional luxury trappings, including on-the-water activities, several dining options, and a high-end spa. Reader Score: 98.88 23. Nihi Sumba: Sumba, Indonesia Georg Schorschal/Courtesy of NIHI Sumba Located in Eastern Indonesia, this legendary resort retains many of the same draws that made it a must-visit when it first opened, as Nihiwatu, in 2001: surf, sand, splendid isolation. In 2016 and 2017, readers ranked it the No. 1 hotel in the world. Today, it remains a 27-villa paragon of barefoot luxury — and of philanthropy, by way of the Sumba Foundation, which supports the surrounding community. Reader Score: 98.85 24. Hotel Hartness: Greenville, South Carolina Courtesy of Hotel Hartness Just about a year after opening its doors, this 73-suite, family-owned hotel in Greenville is now the No. 1 best resort in South Carolina. Inspired by the design of the Hartness family’s own home, the property is modern yet welcoming, featuring a full-service spa and two dining options. Reader Score: 98.80 24. Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Goa: Goa, India Courtesy of Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Goa Concealed in the greenery on the edge of Radhanagar Beach, this 46-acre property in India’s remote Andaman Islands doesn’t need to advertise its seclusion. The raised villas — an homage to the traditional homes of local Indigenous communities — and three dining options supplied by the on-site organic garden are just two reasons why this Taj dream made the 2024 list. Reader Score: 98.80 26. The Peninsula Istanbul: Istanbul, Turkey Emre Dorter/Courtesy of The Peninsula Hotels The new Peninsula hotel, which opened in February 2023, occupies a series of historic — and now beautifully refurbished — buildings along the Bosphorus. “The crisp service, the walkable location, and the top-tier amenities give it an edge,” wrote editor-in-chief Jacqui Gifford in her recent rave review, a sentiment shared by WBA voters. Reader Score: 98.77 27. (tie) The Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra: Agra, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts One of the most enchanting resorts in India, the Amarvilas overlooks the Taj Mahal, a short walk away. Views of the famed mausoleum aside, the property also impresses with its manicured gardens, lovely swimming pool, and fantastic cuisine — not to mention a peaceful terrace that’s the perfect spot for a sundowner. Reader Score: 98.74 27. (tie) The St. Regis Bali Resort: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The St. Regis Bali Resort On the shores of Nusa Dua Beach is an escape in the jungle. Guests can stay in a garden-view suite, with the sound of waves streaming through the windows, or one of the 41 villas featuring private pools and outdoor lounge areas. Either way, a stay here is “exquisite,” says one reader, no doubt in part thanks to The St. Regis’ famed 24-hour butler service. Reader Score: 98.74 29. Asilia Namiri Plains: Serengeti National Park, Tanzania Courtesy of Asilia Namiri Plains “This is big cat country,” is how Asilia, the luxury safari operator, describes the location of its remote, 11-tent escape that’s a haven for those in search of cheetahs, leopards, lions, and servals. A pair of larger “retreats,” with two bedrooms and private staff, are perfect for families or groups of friends. Reader Score: 98.73 30. Candleberry Inn: Brewster, Massachusetts Courtesy of Candleberry Inn “It’s like a big warm hug,” said one reader of the newly named No. 1 property on T+L’s Best Continental U.S. Inn list. Priding itself on “simple elegance,” the Candleberry Inn offers a comfortable stay in a historic home in the heart of Cape Cod — a quintessential New England experience. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Finch Hattons: Tsavo West National Park, Kenya Courtesy of Finch Hattons A classic safari lodge in one of Kenya’s most noteworthy wildlife areas, Finch Hattons has been impressing guests for more than 30 years, thanks to top-notch guides, excellent game spotting, and plenty of family-friendly amenities, including a Masai Warrior Training program for children. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Rosewood Phnom Penh: Phnom Penh, Cambodia Courtesy of Rosewood Phnom Penh Hotels with views aren’t a new feat, but this hotel soaring more than 615 feet above Cambodia’s largest city, spread across the top 14 floors, is truly one of a kind. Readers praised this property for its location, the “excellent service,” and the food — serving traditional Cambodian cuisine, as well as French, Japanese, and Chinese too, across six venues. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Royal Champagne Hotel & Spa: Champagne, France Courtesy of Royal Champagne Hotel & Spa Described by one reader as a “hidden gem in the Champagne countryside,” this 47-room property has taken the top spot as the best resort in France. It’s a wine-enthusiast’s haven, with a selection of more than 850 different vintages and champagnes, plus an in-room “Champagne Please” button that will bring bubbles right to your door. Reader Score: 98.67 30. The Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur: Udaipur, India Aparna Jayakumar Three properties in the lakeside city of Udaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, made the top 100 this year, proof that this evocative destination remains top of mind for T+L readers. The Oberoi charmed voters with its opulent design, orchestrated by Bill Bensley to mimic the palatial architecture seen around Lake Pichola, as well as its top-notch dining and can-do staff. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Tokoriki Island Resort: Tokoriki Island, Fiji Courtesy of Tokoriki Island Resort This first-time winner is so loved, it had two readers crying when they left the property. With only 36 beachfront villas, this adults-only oasis offers privacy like no other, as well as direct access to everything the island has to offer, like diving, an herbal medicine walk, sailing, and more. Reader Score: 98.67 36. The Leela Palace Bengaluru: Bangalore, India Courtesy of Leela Palace Bengaluru One of three Leela Palace properties in the top 100, and the one with the highest score, this grand dame in the middle of India’s Silicon Valley stands out for its dining options, “impeccable” service, and most of all, its design. The nine acres of manicured grounds and pink sandstone facade had one reader “captivated by the grandeur and elegance of the architecture, which truly made me feel like royalty.” Reader Score: 98.59 37. Villa Mara: Carmel-By-The-Sea, California Courtesy of Villa Mara Just two years old, this chic, 16-room luxury boutique is new to the annual World’s Best List, and it has readers talking. Readers noted the delicious on-site breakfast, superb location within Carmel-By-The-Sea, and all are aligned on the quality of the service. Another quipped: “From the design, to service, food and drinks, and location, literally everything is idyllic; I would have paid twice as much.” Reader Score: 98.55 38. Secret Bay: Portsmouth, Dominica Courtesy of Secret Bay The top-rated Caribbean resort for 2024, this Dominica hideaway has just 19 villas, each with a private pool and plentiful indoor/outdoor space. Guests can count on the expert advice of a team of hosts and concierges who can arrange just about anything, whether that’s a private couples massage or a paddleboarding excursion for the family.
