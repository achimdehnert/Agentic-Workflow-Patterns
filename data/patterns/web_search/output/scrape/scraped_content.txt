The tzatziki and pita is tasty and fresh. We opted to have gyro's and they were delicious. We split a Greek salad and while it was fresh it was missing a "dressing". Salad was "bland". In stead of fries I opted for a side of the lemon potatoes, which were cooked perfectly but literally had no flavor.Service is pleasant and it's very, very nice inside. I asked the waitress about Dolma's and she indicated they were just too time consuming to fix. See all photos from Terry J. for Agora Greek Restaurant The service and service was amazing. Great selection to choose from. Clean. Neat, quaint location. Definitely recommend. See all photos from Nilsa A. for Agora Greek Restaurant Great Greek goods with great service! Dishes were indeed tasty! We had the calamari and octopus for our appetizers and gyro platter & lamb shank. I tasted the Greek coffee which was strong. I would order everything again and would recommend this place to family and friends. See all photos from Van L. for Agora Greek Restaurant Restaurant is lovely inside. I look forward to their patio in the near future when it's a little warmer.Food was really good. You will have sticker shock when you see the menu however the portions were very large. Gyro platter was delicious and there's well enough food for two meals off it. You get your money worth. Spanakopita was also really good and there was enough for three of us to snack on. Food came out quick and hot. Will definitely return and glad to have this place in the area!Only downside the drinks are a bit high price wise for what you get. Hope there's some happy hour options in the future, or better drink prices. Especially since their bar is open. Gyro platter I have never been a big salad person until now! Who would have believed a salad without any lettuce could be SO delicious!!! The Greek Village Salad has converted me. What about appetizers? Many different choices but the appetizers are amazing, such as the crispy calamari or the baked feta, which is my wife's favorite. Entrees? I've yet to have something I didn't enjoy: I am a huge fan of the lamb shank, short rib and especially the lamb chops but I'm also equally drawn to the bolognese and mushroom asparagus risotto.Great great great experience and highly recommended! See all photos from Bobby J. for Agora Greek Restaurant You must try the Tirokafteri- best appetizer I have tried in a long time. The Gyro sandwich was very good, and I really liked the Lamb shank, but it is a must too order the Tirokafteri!Great ambiance, but service was a little slow, so I'd give them 4 and 1/2 stars, but bumping them to 5 for the Tirokafteri and they haven't been opened long, so that's a factor too. Lamb shank and gyro sandwiche On my 3rd visit around diner time, we were seated at the booths. Got into a confused "what are you seeing on your list? Where?!", about what to order and realized it was because the menus were different! New menu had removed items and higher prices which is odd considering the place hasn't been open long. I wanted the beef/lamb gyro again (that I loved btw), and was told it was not available for dinner hours even though it was previously available for dinner. When I questioned why remove such a staple Greek item I was met with shrugs and that I couldn't have it. So we walked out due to frustration and disappointment about the new menu structure. Exceeded expectations. Food was piping hot and fresh. Fully stuffed gyro was excellent. Looking forward to future visit! Read more Place was locked on a Saturday at 6. Not sure if it's open or not. My reservation went thru on opentable though I came here once with my wife and ordered the hummus appetizer. It was served with 2 servings of pita (2 pieces of pita cut into 4 slices). I could see from the amount of hummus that it would not be enough so asked for more pita. I was told that I had to pay for more pita and asked if I still wanted it. I thought that was really petty to charge people for things like that but didn't want to argue.Came back again with a party of 4 and this time ordered 3 different appetizer dips. They again only brought out 2 servings of pita, which was clearly not enough for 4 people having 3 dips. I pointed out to the waiter that the bread they gave was not enough for 4 people and again, they said they would charge more for additional bread. Ridiculous!We very quickly finished eating our 2 pieces of pita and waited and waited and waited for the waiter to return with the additional bread. After a long time waiting, I went into the restaurant and saw our teenaged waiter standing and chatting with his friends and not paying attention to his job. I asked to talk to a manager.A lady walked over to me and didn't say anything. I told her that I was with a party of 4 and had ordered 3 dips but were only given 2 servings of pita and didn't understand why we had to pay for additional bread to go with the dips. She then cut me off and said "they only brought you 2 pitas?" I said yes they only brought two. Then I told her that I ordered more bread and the waiter never brought it, to which she again said "so you only have two pieces of bread?" I again told her yes only 2 breads and to please bring out the additional bread that I ordered.A long time goes by and it's clear that they're not going to bring the bread and our appetizer dips just sat there. Eventually the waiter brought out our entrees, and then afterwards, brought out the pita (probably so they could still charge us). The waiter never came back until long after we had finished our meals.What a miserable experience it is to have to deal with a clueless teenager waiter, to be told that I have to pay extra to get the bread that should go with the appetizer - and still not get it, and to be treated so rudely by the manager. I am embarrassed that I brought the rest of my family here and they had to endure all this nonsense. Service was very poor. The hostess was nice but our server was just bad. From the fact we got given "free" bread/pita by the hostess and told if we wanted more to ask for it, and when we did our server said it would be $3, that was just abrasive. I have no problem paying for bread but not after I was just told it was free lol. Next was zero water refills for 15min. Food took forever to come out so at least some water would have been nice. Appetizer was $14 for 5 shrimp lol. Just ridiculous. My husband got the lamb because the spare ribs were not on the menu apparently. That seems to be a trend here. Salmon was nice but couscous was cold and bland. Overall I wasn't impressed at all and I would not return based on this. There was zero customers when we arrived and their prices are way above what they should be. I can see why there wasn't much business in the place but perhaps better service and drop prices down 3-4$ would bring in a better crowed. 1 star for the hostess and 1 for the salmon. 3 other reviews that are not currently recommended You Might Also Consider Mountain Mike’s Pizza in Chicken Wings, Pizza True Food Kitchen in New American, Breakfast & Brunch, Comfort Food Phone number (972) 292-9759 Get Directions 5480 Fm 423 Unit 100 Frisco, TX 75036 Suggest an edit You Might Also Consider Pinstack El Pollo Loco Collections Including Agora Greek Restaurant 7 7 My Neighborhood By Benjina D. 187 187 Frisco Must Do By Chana J. 74 74 My Neighborhood By Brad J. 13 13 girls night By Amanda L. 150 150 Frisco Eats By Cortney K. 53 53 Sister Food Squad By Shannon N. 7 7 2023 ‘Burb noms By Alexa E. 80 80 Dallas By Tami F.
