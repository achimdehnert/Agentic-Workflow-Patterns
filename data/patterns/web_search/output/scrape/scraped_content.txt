Key West is well known for its free-spirited independence, and you can certainly come as you are in this quirky place where roosters roam the streets alongside revelers. Key West is not just a party town, though, and its many personalities are most evident in its spate of resorts. Whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway, a high-energy friends weekend, or a family vacation, there is a perfect place to rest your head. And no matter where you stay, from the moment you arrive you’ll feel an instant wave of relaxation. Here's our list of the best hotels in Key West. Read our complete Key West travel guide here. Every hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date. This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date. Casa Marina Key WestArrow Opened on New Year’s Day in 1920 by Henry Flagler, Casa Marina has lived many lives over the last century, under multiple brands and even more attempts to revive its original grandeur. Finally, as part of Hilton’s Curio Collection and after an $79 million dollar renovation, the grande dame returns to peak form in 2024 with a fresh, locally inspired take on the historic property, located on the southern edge of Key West with its own private beach. All 311 rooms and suites have been completely redone, down to the patterned flooring and up to the wooden roof trusses, and feature tasteful assemblies of rattans, woven fabrics, wooden furnishings, and open cabinetry that scream new-meets-old Florida tropical chic. Outside, Casa Marina’s 1,100 feet of private beach, lined with loungers, an oceanfront lawn, a beachfront restaurant, sand sculptures, and framed by two piers, is the most prized swath on the island (and the very dreamy beach scene missing at other resorts in rocky Key West.) New lobby bar Canary Room is pure Instagram (and mixology) gold with floral, hand-painted walls by local artist, Katlin Spain, and artisan cocktails including ones made with a Papa’s Pilar Rum exclusive to the property. Sunset Key CottagesArrow Sunset Key is a private-island splurge that feels worlds away from the mainland. The tropical island comprises private homes and a boutique resort of forty pastel cottages, surrounded by nothing but lush gardens loaded with frangipani, sand, and turquoise blue waters. Spacious cottages are perfectly beachy, but some are more modern than others. At a minimum, each has a living room, pull out sofa, and kitchenette, pre-stocked with complimentary select drinks, snacks, and wine (which can be enhanced with additional items for a fee). There’s a zero-entry pool at the heart of the island, but the best water action is around the beach, where lounge chairs, palapas and a volleyball net await. Latitudes restaurant also offers a front-row seat to the blue waters and can be visited even if not staying at Sunset Key Cottages. To get here, you'll need to take a quick seven-minute ride from the resort's private boat launch on the mainland, located in front of sister property Opal Key Resort & Marina. Boats run twice per hour. Southernmost Beach ResortArrow This vast tropical temptation is a stone’s throw away from the southernmost point in the continental US, in a relatively quieter part of Key West. Cast over 6.5 acres and across multiple blocks, the grounds at Southernmost Beach Resort encompass a total of eight pastel-blue low-rises (housing a total of 244 units) and four guest houses (named Avalon, La Mer, Duval Gardens, and Dewey Houses, collectively accommodating 52 rooms), interspersed by palm trees, myriad swimming pools and, in some cases, ocean blues. Building rooms were renovated between 2021 and 2022 while guest house units were reimagined in late 2023, now boasting new-fashioned takes on Victorian-style interiors and thoughtful design-driven touches like hand-stenciled walls. Relaxation beckons at the resort’s oceanfront west lawn, strewn with hammocks and wooden lounge chairs. Meanwhile, fun in the sun awaits at Southernmost’s three lounger-lined swimming pools (don’t miss the live music daily at the Pineapple Pool) plus its two beach areas, where guests are guaranteed two chairs and an umbrella as part of the daily resort fee. Pier House Resort & SpaArrow Another Key West icon, Pier House made its name in the '70s as a haven for the creative set. Today, it's a sprawling resort right on the water, with plenty of activities, an excellent spa, and great dining options (including the bar where Jimmy Buffet had his first gig). Some rooms have that Old Florida classic décor—think plenty of rattan—but suites have patios or balconies, making them ideal for enjoying a Key West sunset. Beds and amenities are nice, too. Pier House is in the middle of it all, but once you're facing the ocean, you'll forget all about the hullabaloo on Duval Street. Parrot Key Hotel & VillasArrow Recently refreshed, Parrot Key is yet another historic Keys property that's back and better than ever. The verdant grounds have four pools; the resort's rooms, suites, and villas, meanwhile, all have views of the gardens or the Gulf of Mexico. Even the entry-level rooms span 375 square feet and receive loads of light, which accents the neutral gray and tan decor. Little touches, like L'Occitane amenities, upgrade the experience. This resort is beautifully renovated and reasonably priced, and the four pools ensure you're never fighting for a lounge chair. Island House Key West ResortArrow At the edge of Old Key West, Island House Key West is found among the island’s residential cluster of historic homes and inns along Fleming Street. Key West has long been a refuge for those rebelling against imposed social norms and, as such, has reigned a popular destination for the gay community since the 1970s. While most resorts nowadays in Key West are predictably mainstream and family-friendly, the adults-only, clothing-optional Island House Resort Key West is a testament to the island’s progressive, free-spirited ethos. If you’re not a gay man, look elsewhere; but if you are and desire a vibrant, 39-room haven with hedonistic overtones, reconsider the area's heteronormative hotel choices and check into the Island House. Ocean Key Resort & SpaArrow If Tommy Bahama designed a resort, it would look like Ocean Key. It has an air of nostalgia about it, almost if Hemingway himself could be posted up at the bar. Rooms and suites feature pastel-hued walls, cheery floral and striped fabrics, and colorful rugs: In short, it’s tropical island vacation décor to a tee and done with an elegant touch. Balconies overlook the Gulf of Mexico or Duval Street, adding to the sense of place. Eating and drinking are two important elements to an Ocean Key stay, too. At the property’s colorful and colossal, 4000 square foot Sunset Pier, enjoy live music, far too many cocktails, and of course, epic sunsets, thanks to the pier’s unobstructed water views. Additionally, restaurant Hot Tin Roof is a top table in the Keys, lauded for an innovative, seafood-centric menu with dishes like seared scallops and colossal shrimp in almond mole and plantain crusted swordfish with roasted corn salsa and tequila poblano sauce. Both are worth the visit, even if not staying at Ocean Key. The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph CollectionArrow A departure from the area's pastel B&Bs and kid-packed resorts, The Saint is a swanky, sexy boutique hotel with just 36 rooms tucked away from Duval Street and a place where the points-obsessed crowd can accrue Marriott Bonvoy points aplenty. Rooms are decorated in the hotel's signature blue-and-white color scheme, with mood lighting to drive the vibe home. It can all feel like a bit much, but under the snazzy facade are contemporary and classy details, including Frette linens and Niven Morgan toiletries. Once you step outside, you'll find that you're right in the heart of everything Key West has to offer. The Marquesa HotelArrow You're in for a special stay at this historic hotel on the National Register of Historic Places, just a block off Duval Street. The vibe is old Key West to the max—in the best way imaginable—including a tropical interior courtyard where a patio overlooks the pool and butterflies flit. Well-appointed rooms are housed in separate Key West style cottages and sister hostel, Marquesa 414, lies across the street and up half a block in a newer building. There are a total of 44 rooms between the two (called Marquesa Hotel collectively), three pools, and the illustrious Café Marquesa, often cited as Key West’s top restaurant. Standout dishes like the yellowtail snapper over key west shrimp creole and creamy yellow grits and the grilled swordfish piccata are every bit the heavenly seafood experience travelers covet in an oceanfront destination while the doughy, sugar-dusted beignets are true dessert divinity (and superlative to any we’ve sampled in New Orleans.) Overall, Marquesa shines for its true sense of place, zero kitsch, foodie-forward approach, and historic charm presented in an updated way. The Marker Harbor ResortArrow Two acres of tropical gardens. Three pools. A harborfront location with a breezy, laidback vibe yet still close to the action. Need we say more? It’s lively but not raucous. Luxurious, but not stuffy. Cool, but not so hip that it hurts. The 96 rooms and suites are the very picture of contemporary coastal chic, with clean lines and carpets echoing the waves just outside the oversized windows. Natural light floods these rooms, while bright pops of color in the pillows and artwork lend a sense of place without reading cliché tropical. Starboard Restaurant & Bar features all-day dining from 11am to 6pm Mon – Wed and 11am to closing (based on business), Thur – Sun. The daytime cocktails are especially enticing (who doesn’t want a Key West Spritzer with a view of the harbor?). Overall, The Marker gives you the best of both worlds—water views and a lush, tropical setting, plus proximity to the excitement of Old Town and Duval Street. Winslow's BungalowsArrow A campus of multiple, white-washed cottages and former homes cast predominantly in classic Key West architectural style, Winslow’s Bungalows is a history-steeped retreat two blocks from Duval Street. Formerly part of the Kimpton portfolio, the 85-unit property still oozes retro-chic decor and draws a cool (often pet-obsessed) crowd. Not much has changed since reintegrating into Key West Historic Inns Collection in January 2024: Winslow’s retains an intimate setting, where you’ll feel more like a guest in a private home than in a hotel. Several pools, including a large heated one, and lots of relaxation nooks (hello: hammocks) dot the beautifully landscaped enclave, and continental breakfast is a standard inclusion in all stays. Though Winslow’s remains pet-friendly in life after Kimpton, there is a nightly fee worth noting ($50 per pet, per night). Considering the campus houses one of Key West’s oldest homes and oldest lodging, dating to 1856, it’s worth asking the front desk for a quick primer in Winslow’s history. Opal Key Resort & MarinaArrow Steps from Mallory Square, a block from Duval Street, and fronting the cruise ship pier, Opal Key calls to those looking for the thick of Key West’s touristy action (with water views to boot). Prior to its incorporation into the growing Opal Collection in 2021, the property flew under various brand flags through decades past, including Hilton, Westin, and then Margaritaville. Across two buildings, there are a total of 178 rooms and suites dressed in coastal motifs with soft colors and wood furnishings. Overall, the interiors could use some zhuzhing, but the location is tops for Key West’s party vibe and the amenities are well done (These include a highly social pool scene, a state-of-the-art gym, and a Sunset Deck with views of the nightly sunset celebration on the pier.)

The resort’s signature fine dining restaurant, Hot Tin Roof, serves an elevated take on the island’s classic “Floribbean” fare—think seared black grouper in coconut curry and crispy whole yellowtail snapper. Ocean Key Resort has a breezy beach house aesthetic with polished limestone floors, rustic wood-paneled ceilings and cool-toned turquoise and lime furnishings. As an added bonus, each of the resort’s 100 rooms and suites boast balconies with full or partial harbor views. Best Hotel In Key West Old Town: The Marquesa Hotel A Junior Suite at the Marquesa Hotel. The Marquesa Hotel A boutique hotel on Fleming Street in the heart of Old Town, The Marquesa Hotel is one of the most sophisticated lodgings on the island. With just 27 rooms inside four restored, Victorian-style conch cottages dating back to the late 1800s, it’s all charming tin roofs, pastel siding and white wrap-around balconies with lush tropical flora. Tucked away beneath palm fronds, you’ll find two secluded courtyard swimming pools. And while no two rooms are exactly alike, most are spacious with high gloss Brazilian cherry hardwood floors and a mélange of substantial, wooden furniture, sourced from the West Indies to the Philippines and England. Its on-site restaurant is widely regarded as one of the best in Key West with creative preparations of local seafood, like seared black grouper with basil blue crab and saffron aioli. Best Boutique Hotel In Key West: The Grand Maloney A room at the Grand Maloney. The Grand Maloney Since its opening in May 2022, the Grand Maloney has dazzled design lovers as one of the most stylish boutique hotels in Key West. With only five rooms and one freestanding carriage house (decked out with its own private outdoor shower), the property treats guests to an intimate stay in a Victorian-style mansion with a wraparound porch, a stately turret and a rare brick façade just a block off Duval on lovely Caroline Street. Owned by a multi-generational Key West family, the historic architecture was preserved, while the interiors have been updated with luxurious finishes and designer furniture. No two rooms are alike and some follow a color-coordinated scheme—the Red Room’s ceiling is painted fire engine red, the Yellow Room’s shower is tiled in canary yellow, etc. While there’s no restaurant onsite, the best of Key West is at your doorstep. A small courtyard swimming pool is the icing on this high-design cake. Best Hotel In Key West Near Mallory Square: Opal Key Resort And Marina Pool at Opal Key Resort And Marina.

The novelty comes with NYAH’s flexible guest rooms, which can sleep up to six adults in twin bunk beds. While strictly no frills, rooms are clean and functional, with a private bathroom, mini fridge and individual lockers; and beds are surprisingly comfortable, each with its own night-light and charging station. A spacious central courtyard in red brick is home to three small swimming pools and a hot tub encircled by lush, green foliage providing ample space to relax and soak up the sun. Situated within a block of the Historic Seaport and a short walk to Duval Street, the area’s residential charm with pastel conch cottages and quaint cafes, restaurants and art galleries offers up the magic sought from a Key West vacation. Best Hotel For Families In Key West: Parrot Key Hotel And Villas Exterior of Parrot Key Hotel And Villas. Parrot Key Hotel And Villas Tucked away in a corner of New Town overlooking the Florida Bay on the island’s northern side, Parrot Key Hotel & Villas has the feeling of its own private paradise. And while you’re a solid 10 to 15 minutes to the attractions of Old Town (by complimentary shuttle), you won’t mind the slightly isolated location once you surrender to Parrot Key’s luxurious, tropical environs. Among its 148 spacious guest rooms are suites and villas that range from one- to three-bedrooms, it makes for a perfect family getaway. With four swimming pools and a waterfront white sand terrace with hammocks and lounges, there’s plenty of space to spread out for play or relaxation.

The interiors are sultry yet streamlined, with each of the 36 guest rooms featuring the hotel’s signature nautical color scheme with blue LED lighting and sheer drapes for a boudoir-inspired touch. We’re partial to the ground-floor King rooms with balconies that open onto the tranquil infinity pool in the courtyard. A rollicking rooftop bar offers live music and the on-site restaurant, Tempt, is a hot spot for delicious happy hour cocktails and late-night bites. Despite all the action, the hotel is blissfully quiet in the evening, making it a perfect respite after some fun on the strip. Best Hotel In Key West Near The Seaport: The Marker Key West Harbor Resort A patio view at the Marker Hotel in Key West, FL.

Guests can laze the day away on the hotel’s private beach, work up a sweat on the tennis court and cool off with a dip in the lagoon-style swimming pool. Cottages, ranging from one- to four-bedrooms, have wraparound porches and balconies, wooden bed frames and full kitchens with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances. Some cottages even boast private pools. Make a golden-hour reservation at Latitudes restaurant for a meal of fresh fish paired with nature’s stunning sunset show. Best Beachfront Hotel In Key West: Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection By Hilton The walkway leading to the swimming pools and beach for guests. Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection By Hilton Oil tycoon Henry Flagler, who also built the Overseas Railroad connecting Key West to the mainland, created the Mediterranean Revival-style Casa Marina. With 6.5 oceanfront acres, stucco arcades and a Spanish tile roof, the resort on the National Register of Historic Places channels the glamour of the Roaring Twenties. The hotel officially opened on New Year’s Eve 1920 and has been a favorite of celebrities and visiting dignitaries ever since. The high-ceilinged lobby has Cypress wood beams and columns and glossy hardwood floors. And while guest rooms with neutral contemporary furnishings are a bit basic for such an opulent historic structure, all is forgiven at the elaborate poolscape where two symmetric pools flank a wide walkway leading to the 1,000-foot-long soft sand beach reserved exclusively for guests. Best Historic Hotel In Key West: The Mansion On The Sea Exterior of The Mansion On The Sea. The Mansion On The Sea The ornate sea foam green and conch shell pink Victorian mansion at the southern end of Duval Street is the historic Mansion on the Sea, originally built as a private residence in 1897. Today, it’s home to 18 unique guest rooms and a sublime zero-entry infinity pool dotted with hammocks leading to an oceanfront sun deck. Over the years, the mansion’s hosted everyone from Ernest Hemingway to Leonard Bernstein and John F. Kennedy, and you’ll find ephemera from its long history throughout the lobby, including one of Thomas Edison’s original phonographs. Every guest room has its own unique layout and design, many decked out with four-poster beds and original art. The poolside bar is a great gathering place for cocktails and lobster pizza, and the mansion also provides a complimentary continental breakfast. Best Off-The-Beaten-Path Hotel In Key West: The Perry Hotel And Marina A room with a view at the Perry Hotel. The Perry Hotel And Marina Separated from Key West by the narrow Cow Key Channel, Stock Island is the area’s last working waterfront and feels more industrial than the rest of Key West. The Perry Hotel and Marina, which opened in 2017, gives travelers unprecedented access to this slice of “old Key West” where longtime Keys families, fishermen and artists reside. There’s nothing old-timey about the clean-lined hotel with plenty of raw concrete, exposed steel and natural wood. With its location in Stock Island Marina Village, fishing and boating charter possibilities are endless. The hotel’s excellent Matt’s Stock Island Kitchen and Bar (where fresh seafood featured in dishes like cioppino and shrimp and grits comes directly from the working boats on the waterfront) is worth visiting even if you’re not staying at the hotel. Hotel guests can also lounge by the waterfront pool and sip a cocktail by the fire pits at sunset. Best Pet-Friendly Hotel In Key West: Winslow's Bungalows The exterior of Winslow's Bungalows.

Why Trust Forbes Vetted About Shayne Benowitz, Your Key West Guide Before I launched my career in journalism and travel writing over a decade ago, I worked for a water sports company in Key West and spent my days taking passengers snorkeling at the reef, sunset sailing and parasailing. My favorite destinations include boating and beaches, whether that's sailing the Mediterranean from Sardinia to Corsica or spearfishing in uncharted waters in the Bahamas. With a firm belief that where you stay sets the tone for your trip, I love discovering new hotels. Over the years, I've checked into nearly every hotel in South Florida. Today, I split my time between Manhattan and South Beach, and I get back to Key West frequently. My writing has appeared in Condé Nast Traveler, Afar, Nat Geo Traveler, The New York Post and Catamaran Literary Reader. More Travel Stories:
