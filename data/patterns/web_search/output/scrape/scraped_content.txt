What hotels in Los Angeles have nice views? City of Dreams Exploring Los Angeles, the place where many movies are made, you feel like you’re in a dream. Santa Monica Pier is the ending point of fabled Route 66, while just south is bohemian Venice Beach, lined by tall, swaying palms. Go slightly inland from the boardwalk to glimpse the canals that earned the area its name. Head north to the golden beach and stunning scenery of Malibu and see why movie stars over the decades have settled here. Also popular with the rich and famous are Bel Air and Beverly Hills, home to exclusive Rodeo Drive. And the reason for all this glitz and glamour? Hollywood, of course! Sitting high on a hill, the iconic sign is visible for miles around, while below the gold stars on Hollywood Boulevard immortalise celebrities of past and present. Be there on premiere night to see them grace the red carpet of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. Over the hill is Universal Studios, offering behind-the-scenes tours as well as rides. Next door are the Warner Brothers Studios, and Paramount Studios are closer to Downtown LA. Whether you decide to live like a star in a luxury LA hotel or choose a cheap motel through Booking.com, it’s worth renting a car to get around this sprawling city and out to Los Angeles Airport (LAX).

One of the best things about Los Angeles is that there’s something to suit every traveler, whether you’re in the mood for a laidback beach holiday, an active nature-filled adventure, a cultural extravaganza, or a high-octane urban break. The same can be said for the city’s many hotels, which check all the boxes when it comes to finding a place to rest your head. The city is perhaps most famous for its five-star luxury properties, which you’ll find nestled among the palm trees in Beverly Hills or on the beachfront of Santa Monica. Many have been here since Hollywood’s Golden Age and have more than a few eyebrow-raising stories written into their walls. But LA is also home to charming B&Bs, hip budget hotels, and family-friendly establishments that every age group will love. Read on to discover our pick of the best hotels in Tinseltown. Explore more articles The Beverly Hills Hotel Few places in Los Angeles can conjure up old Hollywood magic like the Beverly Hills Hotel. Affectionately known as the Pink Palace, the glamorous five-star spot has played host to everyone from Marilyn Monroe to Elizabeth Taylor (both were such regulars they even have bungalows in the grounds named after them). With its elegantly appointed rooms, suites and bungalows, palm-tree lined pool, and plush spa, a stay here will have you feeling like a bona fide star in no time. Chateau Marmont Ever since it first opened its doors in the late 1920s, the stories about the Chateau have made it one of the most iconic hotels in LA, if not the world. The West Hollywood institution has been the establishment of choice for raucous rockers for decades – it was here that Led Zeppelin drove their Harley Davidsons into the lobby, and where Jim Morrison used to swing between the balconies. From the Gothic-glam lobby to the chicly pared-back bungalows, it remains one of LA’s must-stay hotels for travelers who appreciate the finer things in life, with a healthy dose of hedonism thrown in for good measure. Shutters on the Beach There are few places in LA where you can walk out of your hotel and feel the sand beneath your toes, but Shutters is one of those places. Set right on Santa Monica beach, it’s one of the most sought-after properties in the city, and with good reason. The nautical-inspired décor adds to the relaxed beach house vibe, where the rooms are decked out in a chic white and blue color scheme and wooden shutters that open onto private balconies with ocean views. It remains a firm favorite with visitors looking for coastal luxury. The Surfrider Los Angeles is known for its sun, sea, and surf, all of which can be found at this laidback Malibu spot. Set just off the Pacific Coast Highway, the hotel’s light, bright rooms all come with balconies that offer incredible views over the ocean as well as custom surfboards to hire, so you can master the waves at popular Surfrider Beach just across the road. The hotel draws a cool crowd, who you’ll find gathered around the fire pit on the roof terrace come sunset. The Hollywood Roosevelt There’s plenty of Hollywood history at this central spot. Opened in 1927 by four of the biggest names in the film industry, it was here that the first-ever Academy Awards were held in 1929, taking over the hotel’s Blossom Room. Hollywood’s elite have continued to flock here ever since, though these days it is best known for its striking interiors, which feature many original period details, and its arty crowd and outdoor pool that has a one-off mural by David Hockney at the bottom. Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons This luxe Beverly Hills property, located just steps from Rodeo Drive, offers a swanky LA stay that every member of the family will love. The opulent marble-clad lobby, with its crystal chandelier and bold contemporary artwork, is pure Hollywood glamour, while the chicly minimal rooms offer a calm respite from the hectic city. Youngers guests, meanwhile, will love all the kid-friendly touches, which range from welcome cookies and kids’ menus at the hotel restaurants to special miniature-sized children’s furniture around the outdoor pool. Channel Road Inn Quaint B&Bs in Los Angeles can be hard to come by, but this seaside spot in Santa Monica is one of the most charming around. There are 15 rooms dotted around the Colonial Revival home, including several spacious suites with private patios and four-poster beds. Cozy touches like homemade cookies, beach toys for the kids, and a daily wine and hors d’oeuvres hour in the sitting room only add to the appeal, making it the ideal place to stay for those looking to experience a quieter side of LA life. Hotel Erwin If sunset vistas are your thing, the hotel’s rooftop bar is one of the most popular spots in the area to come and watch the sun sink into the Pacific. If you’re looking for somewhere that embodies the quirky charm of Venice Beach, Hotel Erwin is the place to come. Located a short walk from the neighborhood’s top sights – including Muscle Beach, the ocean-front Skate Park, and the Venice Boardwalk – it’s the perfect place to stay if you like to be right in the heart of the action. The sleekly decorated rooms are spacious, with cool mid-century furniture and graffitied doors, while many boast balconies with ocean views. The Hoxton, Los Angeles If you’re looking for a lively spot in downtown LA, make a beeline for the Hoxton. Housed in a French Beaux-Arts building that was once the headquarters of the LA Railway Authority, the design-focused interiors were created as a collaboration between the Hoxton team and Soho House, which lends the whole place the air of a hip members’ club. With its rooftop pool serenaded by the sounds of bustling Broadway below, this is the ideal spot for those looking to soak up the city’s buzzy atmosphere. Freehand Los Angeles This downtown spot is a great choice for travelers looking for a more budget-friendly option in the City of Angels. Located in the historic Commercial Exchange building, the unique hotel-hostel hybrid offers something for everyone, whether you’re after a spacious private studio apartment or suite, or a shared dorm where you can meet like-minded travelers and save a few bucks. Whichever option you choose, you’re bound to love Freehand’s effortlessly cool vibe, with its wood-clad lobby, original 1930s tiled bar, and rooftop pool, where punchy cocktails are served alongside stellar views. Mama Shelter This hip hotel just around the corner from the Hollywood Walk of Fame draws a cool young crowd, who love it for its central location and more affordable price point. Its funky décor is also a major plus point, featuring a vibrant mishmash of colorful rugs and textiles, exposed brick walls, and local contemporary art. The hotel’s restaurant, bar, and rooftop are all popular places to come whether you’re a guest or not, particularly on weekends, and the vibe is fun and welcoming – it’s hard to leave without having made a new friend or two.
