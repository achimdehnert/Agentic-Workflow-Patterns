Key West is well known for its free-spirited independence, and you can certainly come as you are in this quirky place where roosters roam the streets alongside revelers. Key West is not just a party town, though, and its many personalities are most evident in its spate of resorts. Whether you’re looking for a romantic getaway, a high-energy friends weekend, or a family vacation, there is a perfect place to rest your head. And no matter where you stay, from the moment you arrive you’ll feel an instant wave of relaxation. Here's our list of the best hotels in Key West. Read our complete Key West travel guide here. Every hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date. This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date. Casa Marina Key WestArrow Opened on New Year’s Day in 1920 by Henry Flagler, Casa Marina has lived many lives over the last century, under multiple brands and even more attempts to revive its original grandeur. Finally, as part of Hilton’s Curio Collection and after an $79 million dollar renovation, the grande dame returns to peak form in 2024 with a fresh, locally inspired take on the historic property, located on the southern edge of Key West with its own private beach. All 311 rooms and suites have been completely redone, down to the patterned flooring and up to the wooden roof trusses, and feature tasteful assemblies of rattans, woven fabrics, wooden furnishings, and open cabinetry that scream new-meets-old Florida tropical chic. Outside, Casa Marina’s 1,100 feet of private beach, lined with loungers, an oceanfront lawn, a beachfront restaurant, sand sculptures, and framed by two piers, is the most prized swath on the island (and the very dreamy beach scene missing at other resorts in rocky Key West.) New lobby bar Canary Room is pure Instagram (and mixology) gold with floral, hand-painted walls by local artist, Katlin Spain, and artisan cocktails including ones made with a Papa’s Pilar Rum exclusive to the property. Sunset Key CottagesArrow Sunset Key is a private-island splurge that feels worlds away from the mainland. The tropical island comprises private homes and a boutique resort of forty pastel cottages, surrounded by nothing but lush gardens loaded with frangipani, sand, and turquoise blue waters. Spacious cottages are perfectly beachy, but some are more modern than others. At a minimum, each has a living room, pull out sofa, and kitchenette, pre-stocked with complimentary select drinks, snacks, and wine (which can be enhanced with additional items for a fee). There’s a zero-entry pool at the heart of the island, but the best water action is around the beach, where lounge chairs, palapas and a volleyball net await. Latitudes restaurant also offers a front-row seat to the blue waters and can be visited even if not staying at Sunset Key Cottages. To get here, you'll need to take a quick seven-minute ride from the resort's private boat launch on the mainland, located in front of sister property Opal Key Resort & Marina. Boats run twice per hour. Southernmost Beach ResortArrow This vast tropical temptation is a stone’s throw away from the southernmost point in the continental US, in a relatively quieter part of Key West. Cast over 6.5 acres and across multiple blocks, the grounds at Southernmost Beach Resort encompass a total of eight pastel-blue low-rises (housing a total of 244 units) and four guest houses (named Avalon, La Mer, Duval Gardens, and Dewey Houses, collectively accommodating 52 rooms), interspersed by palm trees, myriad swimming pools and, in some cases, ocean blues. Building rooms were renovated between 2021 and 2022 while guest house units were reimagined in late 2023, now boasting new-fashioned takes on Victorian-style interiors and thoughtful design-driven touches like hand-stenciled walls. Relaxation beckons at the resort’s oceanfront west lawn, strewn with hammocks and wooden lounge chairs. Meanwhile, fun in the sun awaits at Southernmost’s three lounger-lined swimming pools (don’t miss the live music daily at the Pineapple Pool) plus its two beach areas, where guests are guaranteed two chairs and an umbrella as part of the daily resort fee. Pier House Resort & SpaArrow Another Key West icon, Pier House made its name in the '70s as a haven for the creative set. Today, it's a sprawling resort right on the water, with plenty of activities, an excellent spa, and great dining options (including the bar where Jimmy Buffet had his first gig). Some rooms have that Old Florida classic décor—think plenty of rattan—but suites have patios or balconies, making them ideal for enjoying a Key West sunset. Beds and amenities are nice, too. Pier House is in the middle of it all, but once you're facing the ocean, you'll forget all about the hullabaloo on Duval Street. Parrot Key Hotel & VillasArrow Recently refreshed, Parrot Key is yet another historic Keys property that's back and better than ever. The verdant grounds have four pools; the resort's rooms, suites, and villas, meanwhile, all have views of the gardens or the Gulf of Mexico. Even the entry-level rooms span 375 square feet and receive loads of light, which accents the neutral gray and tan decor. Little touches, like L'Occitane amenities, upgrade the experience. This resort is beautifully renovated and reasonably priced, and the four pools ensure you're never fighting for a lounge chair. Island House Key West ResortArrow At the edge of Old Key West, Island House Key West is found among the island’s residential cluster of historic homes and inns along Fleming Street. Key West has long been a refuge for those rebelling against imposed social norms and, as such, has reigned a popular destination for the gay community since the 1970s. While most resorts nowadays in Key West are predictably mainstream and family-friendly, the adults-only, clothing-optional Island House Resort Key West is a testament to the island’s progressive, free-spirited ethos. If you’re not a gay man, look elsewhere; but if you are and desire a vibrant, 39-room haven with hedonistic overtones, reconsider the area's heteronormative hotel choices and check into the Island House. Ocean Key Resort & SpaArrow If Tommy Bahama designed a resort, it would look like Ocean Key. It has an air of nostalgia about it, almost if Hemingway himself could be posted up at the bar. Rooms and suites feature pastel-hued walls, cheery floral and striped fabrics, and colorful rugs: In short, it’s tropical island vacation décor to a tee and done with an elegant touch. Balconies overlook the Gulf of Mexico or Duval Street, adding to the sense of place. Eating and drinking are two important elements to an Ocean Key stay, too. At the property’s colorful and colossal, 4000 square foot Sunset Pier, enjoy live music, far too many cocktails, and of course, epic sunsets, thanks to the pier’s unobstructed water views. Additionally, restaurant Hot Tin Roof is a top table in the Keys, lauded for an innovative, seafood-centric menu with dishes like seared scallops and colossal shrimp in almond mole and plantain crusted swordfish with roasted corn salsa and tequila poblano sauce. Both are worth the visit, even if not staying at Ocean Key. The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph CollectionArrow A departure from the area's pastel B&Bs and kid-packed resorts, The Saint is a swanky, sexy boutique hotel with just 36 rooms tucked away from Duval Street and a place where the points-obsessed crowd can accrue Marriott Bonvoy points aplenty. Rooms are decorated in the hotel's signature blue-and-white color scheme, with mood lighting to drive the vibe home. It can all feel like a bit much, but under the snazzy facade are contemporary and classy details, including Frette linens and Niven Morgan toiletries. Once you step outside, you'll find that you're right in the heart of everything Key West has to offer. The Marquesa HotelArrow You're in for a special stay at this historic hotel on the National Register of Historic Places, just a block off Duval Street. The vibe is old Key West to the max—in the best way imaginable—including a tropical interior courtyard where a patio overlooks the pool and butterflies flit. Well-appointed rooms are housed in separate Key West style cottages and sister hostel, Marquesa 414, lies across the street and up half a block in a newer building. There are a total of 44 rooms between the two (called Marquesa Hotel collectively), three pools, and the illustrious Café Marquesa, often cited as Key West’s top restaurant. Standout dishes like the yellowtail snapper over key west shrimp creole and creamy yellow grits and the grilled swordfish piccata are every bit the heavenly seafood experience travelers covet in an oceanfront destination while the doughy, sugar-dusted beignets are true dessert divinity (and superlative to any we’ve sampled in New Orleans.) Overall, Marquesa shines for its true sense of place, zero kitsch, foodie-forward approach, and historic charm presented in an updated way. The Marker Harbor ResortArrow Two acres of tropical gardens. Three pools. A harborfront location with a breezy, laidback vibe yet still close to the action. Need we say more? It’s lively but not raucous. Luxurious, but not stuffy. Cool, but not so hip that it hurts. The 96 rooms and suites are the very picture of contemporary coastal chic, with clean lines and carpets echoing the waves just outside the oversized windows. Natural light floods these rooms, while bright pops of color in the pillows and artwork lend a sense of place without reading cliché tropical. Starboard Restaurant & Bar features all-day dining from 11am to 6pm Mon – Wed and 11am to closing (based on business), Thur – Sun. The daytime cocktails are especially enticing (who doesn’t want a Key West Spritzer with a view of the harbor?). Overall, The Marker gives you the best of both worlds—water views and a lush, tropical setting, plus proximity to the excitement of Old Town and Duval Street. Winslow's BungalowsArrow A campus of multiple, white-washed cottages and former homes cast predominantly in classic Key West architectural style, Winslow’s Bungalows is a history-steeped retreat two blocks from Duval Street. Formerly part of the Kimpton portfolio, the 85-unit property still oozes retro-chic decor and draws a cool (often pet-obsessed) crowd. Not much has changed since reintegrating into Key West Historic Inns Collection in January 2024: Winslow’s retains an intimate setting, where you’ll feel more like a guest in a private home than in a hotel. Several pools, including a large heated one, and lots of relaxation nooks (hello: hammocks) dot the beautifully landscaped enclave, and continental breakfast is a standard inclusion in all stays. Though Winslow’s remains pet-friendly in life after Kimpton, there is a nightly fee worth noting ($50 per pet, per night). Considering the campus houses one of Key West’s oldest homes and oldest lodging, dating to 1856, it’s worth asking the front desk for a quick primer in Winslow’s history. Opal Key Resort & MarinaArrow Steps from Mallory Square, a block from Duval Street, and fronting the cruise ship pier, Opal Key calls to those looking for the thick of Key West’s touristy action (with water views to boot). Prior to its incorporation into the growing Opal Collection in 2021, the property flew under various brand flags through decades past, including Hilton, Westin, and then Margaritaville. Across two buildings, there are a total of 178 rooms and suites dressed in coastal motifs with soft colors and wood furnishings. Overall, the interiors could use some zhuzhing, but the location is tops for Key West’s party vibe and the amenities are well done (These include a highly social pool scene, a state-of-the-art gym, and a Sunset Deck with views of the nightly sunset celebration on the pier.)

Get the Reddit app Hotel suggestion? Hi Key West community! My husband and I are spending 4 nights in Key West for the very first time and we’re looking for a great hotel suggestion. We’re in our mid-30s and are looking for a nice hotel that’s in a convenient location. “Nice” to us means very clean, somewhat stylish, and ideally has a good bar or restaurant onsite. We also want a relatively quiet location - it would be fun to be near the action/bars, but we also want to get a good night’s rest without late night street & bar sounds keeping us up :) Budget-wise we’d love to find something under $500 per night, if we can. Currently we have a hold at Casa Marina, but the rooms are super expensive and the online reviews look mixed (overpriced, unstylish, rooms need to be updated etc.) We’ve also considered Havana Cabana, as it looks like a fun, stylish hotel, but the location doesn’t seem as ideal according to reviews. Would love this community’s thoughts on where we should stay! Open to any and all reccos! Top Posts

The Best Hotels in Key West of 2024 Stay at these editor-loved hotels and T+L award winning properties. Katherine Alex Beaven is a Los Angeles-based travel, food and drink, and culture writer. The Marquesa The Florida Keys are a chain of over 1,700 islands off the southern tip of Florida known for their gorgeous water, rich marine life, and quirky, fun-loving attitude. They’re broken up into five regions (or “Keys”) — Key Largo, Islamorada, Marathon, the Lower Keys, and Key West. Of all the Keys, Key West is the most well known. It’s also the farthest south and home to the southernmost point in the United States. In fact, Key West is so far south that it’s actually much closer to Cuba than it is to Miami. It’s no secret that most Floridians don’t consider themselves to be part of the South — but growing up in Florida, I found it amusing that folks in the Florida Keys usually consider themselves separate from mainland Florida, too. However, once I started visiting and learning more about the Keys, particularly Key West, it was obvious that the Florida Keys have a culture all their own. Don’t make the mistake of judging this tiny four-mile island by its size — Key West is a full-fledged destination packed with history, art, food, drink, wildlife, water sports, and culture. Key West is home to the weird and wonderful. This is where you come to sample real key lime pie and conch fritters, where the weather report calls for falling frozen iguanas, and where cats with six toes, life-changing sunsets, and pastel mansions over 150 years old are all in a day’s work. But where to stay while you’re there? The options in Key West can be daunting, but luckily, I, along with Travel + Leisure editors, have been there many times and have scouted some of the best places to stay on the island. We’ve selected a good mix of hotels for every type of traveler, based on our personal experience, recent World’s Best Awards winners, and editor favorites. Read on to find our top picks. Sunset Key Cottages Sunset Key Cottages Also available to book at Tripadvisor.com The private island location adds an extra dose of privacy and solitude that’s still close to the action of Old Town. The resort fee is one of the heftiest we’ve seen. If you’re looking for an island getaway from your island getaway, Sunset Key Cottages offers 40 upscale beachy cottages with up to four bedrooms, superior service, and a relaxing residential island location just a 7-minute boat journey from Old Town. This hotel earned a spot on our World’s Best Awards list in 2021, 2022, and 2023. While the setting can be quite romantic, Sunset Key Cottages is a family-friendly and dog-friendly property. Cottages range between 700 to 2,500 square feet, so there’s room to spread out, and available activities run the gamut from sports courts and spa treatments to pool time and parasailing. Travelers who take advantage of all the property freebies like daily spirits tastings, fishing off the pier, use of the sports courts, poolside popsicles, and daily room-delivered breakfast (just to name a few) will get the most value out of the hefty daily resort fee. The Details: The Perry Hotel & Marina Key West The Perry Hotel & Marina Key West Also available to book at Expedia.com This hotel features direct waterfront views, outdoor showers, and pet-friendly rooms. The marina location is about five miles from the main drag of Duval Street. The Perry Hotel & Marina Key West made our World’s Best Awards list in 2021. We love its Stock Island Marina location, particularly for travelers arriving by boat or looking for a more relaxed Key West experience not centered around the usual Duval Street haunts. This 100-room boutique hotel is somewhat of a Key West outlier, swapping out the island’s common Old Florida colors and aesthetic for an unexpected and sleek modern-industrial look featuring dark wood, grays, and iron accents throughout. Six room types offer options for a glittering marina and pool or lush mangrove view, open-air showers, and ADA accessibility. Flatscreen TVs, coffeemakers, unstocked mini-fridges, and private balconies come standard. The daily resort fee covers expected on-site amenities like the pool, a great concierge service, and use of the fitness room, as well as convenient and fun extras like a very punctual hourly shuttle service to and from Old Town (travel time is about 20 minutes each way), welcome tipple of champagne, a daily drink, an EV charging station, and Saturday group yoga classes. Traveling with your pup? The dog-friendly pet policy has no weight restrictions, and there are two dog parks nearby. The Details: Santa Maria Suites Santa Maria Suites Resort Also available to book at Hotels.com While it doesn’t have all the typical hotel amenities, there are several thoughtful details included in your stay. The apartment-hotel style of this property may not be for everyone. Santa Maria Suites is an all-suite boutique property with large two-bedroom suites clocking in at over 900 square feet. The contemporary apartment-style units have gourmet kitchens with high-end appliances and luxe granite countertops, separate bedrooms, and a furnished patio or balcony with pool or garden views. Tropical garden grounds give guests a relaxing place to get away and decompress after a day out sightseeing. We love the attention to detail this small hotel brings to the table. For example, relaxing by the two heated pools is accompanied by ABV-free frozen drinks, chilled towels, cold bottled water, and fresh fruit. There’s also a free nightly happy hour, all-day muffins and ice cream, and access to beach facilities at the Southernmost Beach. This isn’t a typical hotel with multiple public spaces, but there is a restaurant serving Latin cuisine and a workout area with a few machines available for use. The Details: Gardens Hotel Gardens Hotel The hotel has several eco-friendly practices and awards, and there’s no resort fee. The colonial-style decor can feel dated and there’s no on-site restaurant. You can’t name your hotel after your gardens and not deliver. The Gardens Hotel may be located smack in the middle of Old Town, but this small, ultra-boutique hotel manages to deliver a beautiful sanctuary space filled with plants, birds, water features, and tranquility. Plus, they go the extra mile with eco-friendly practices from recycling to heating water with solar panels. The atmosphere here is social in public spaces, and guests often chat over drinks at the pool or between songs at the Sunday night jazz performances. Rooms are spacious, but feature colonial-style furniture and decor which can feel dated, especially when compared to nearby competitors. But do those hotels have a self-serve wine gallery featuring over 30 wines from around the world? Probably not. Despite having two pools, free Wi-Fi, a stellar hot breakfast, prime location, and concierge services, Gardens Hotel remains resort fee-free. The Details: Ocean Key Resort & Spa Ocean Key Resort & Spa This is the ultimate spot for sunsets and anyone who wants to be at the center of the action on Key West. There is no direct beach access. This 2022 World’s Best Award-winning resort has an enviable location right on the water at the tippy-top of Duval Street, giving guests incredible views of the Gulf of Mexico and easy-as-pie access to the vibrancy of Key West’s main action. Ocean Key Resort & Spa has 100 rooms starting out at 300 square feet and features bright and boisterous contemporary decor, tiled floors, teak wood accents, private balconies, minibars, and stone bathrooms. Upgrades to suites will double, triple, and quadruple your room size, but most in-room amenities stay the same. Whether you’re scoping out the sunset from your room, the pool, or the legendary Sunset Pier, you’ll have one of the best views on the island. However, these memorable waterfront views don’t have a beach, only seawall. Instead, guests soak up the sun at the pool. Food, drinks, and entertainment are available at the poolside bar, rooftop restaurant, and the Sunset Pier. The Details: The Marquesa The Marquesa It’s a historic property with excellent service, a prime location, and a variety of room and suite options. There aren’t a lot of on-property amenities. The Marquesa has lived many lives since it was built in 1884 and is currently listed as an Old Town historic landmark. As a hotel, the 414-room Marquesa now includes one newly-built house and two historic neighboring buildings, a Gothic carpenter-style cottage built in 1878, and a mansion-turned-guesthouse. As you can imagine, the rooms across these buildings range widely in style, size, and design, including open-plan suites, gorgeous slanted ceilings, and hidden alcoves. That said, all rooms and suites have been meticulously renovated and feature contemporary comforts like big beds and Nespresso machines, with options for balconies, kitchenettes, and luxurious bathrooms with soaking tubs. Service here is personal and the staff really goes that extra mile, though the daily resort fee can seem a tad steep considering the on-site amenities are limited to the three lovely pools, Wi-Fi, a daily continental breakfast, and a 24-hour concierge. The Details: Oceans Edge Key West Resort & Marina Oceans Edge Resort & Marina Key West Also available to book at Expedia.com The resort plays up its seaside location with charming nautical-themed decor. Some travelers may prefer to be closer (think: walking distance) to Key West’s main drag. Ocean’s Edge Key West Resort & Spa is a dockside resort on Stock Island. The full-service 165-slip marina makes it easy for you to tie-up and check in. The 175 rooms have a subtle and playful upscale nautical theme featuring bright white paneling, natural wood and navy-colored accents, and views overlooking the marina. While a lot of resorts focus on Key West’s history and main drag, this one encourages visitors to experience the resort’s natural side with activities like paddleboarding, kayaking, outdoor yoga classes, and bike rentals. Boat charters are available through the hotel for private fishing excursions and scenic cruises, all departing straight from their docks. However, our favorite activity is the free one-hour eco-immersion experience where guests learn about the marine ecosystem from a local marine scientist. Guests can also expect their choice of six saltwater pools (with full service), a dock-to-dinner plate restaurant, daily happy hours and live music, and a free hourly shuttle service to Old Town. It’s no wonder this celebrated Key West resort made our World’s Best Awards list in 2022. The Details: H20 Suites It’s an all-suite boutique property with a rooftop pool and nearby beach access. The minimum age is 25. H20 Suites is an all-suite hotel located two blocks from the Southernmost Point, just one block from Duval Street, offering an intimate and tranquil respite from the heavy traffic of Old Town. With just 22 suites, the service here feels extremely personal and guests can look forward to private outdoor space, stocked in-room wet bars, and Italian marble bathrooms. Half of the suites feature private pools, and all have cosmopolitan-modern decor that feels a bit more Miami than Florida Keys. The snazzy rooftop pool and bar is a standout with great views and a happy hour to boot, and we appreciate the 24-hour front desk and concierge service. There’s also a small gym on property. The daily resort fee covers amenities like access to Southernmost Beach (plus beach set-up), a welcome drink, a nightly treat and turndown service, and bottled water. This is an adults-only hotel with a minimum age of 25. The Details: The Capitana Key West The Capitana Key West It’s one of the few hotels in Key West with direct beach access. You can’t swim at the beach and it’s in a slightly industrial part of town that isn’t walkable to Old Town. This waterfront beach boutique hotel has one huge advantage over most of the hotels in Key West — it has its own direct private beach access. The catch? It’s got a rough and rugged coral floor, which means no swimming, just lounging on the sand or in one of the hotel’s comfy cabanas. If you feel like a dip, the next best thing is the hotel’s saltwater pool, complete with ocean views and full service from the poolside tiki bar and restaurant. Rooms are spacious and contemporary with soft, neutral beachy color palettes, comfy beds, and balconies with views of the Gulf of Mexico. Two-bedroom family suites can sleep up to seven, and springing for a cottage will get you over twice the amount of space and add a full kitchen and separate living room lounge area. Although this boutique hotel is family-friendly, it’s a popular spot for couples. Keep in mind that the New Town location is slightly out of the way — ideal if you’re trying to avoid crowds but not if you want to hit all the popular spots. The Details: Simonton Court Historic Inn & Cottages Simonton Court There are some thoughtful freebies and no resort fee. This is a garden-set historic property with very limited accessibility. Simonton Court Historic Inn & Cottages offers up a taste of Key West in the island’s Old Florida style. If you’re looking for a cute and quaint bed and breakfast, this is your frontrunner. Here, 30 rooms are spread out across 10 buildings on five properties, including a set of historic cottages built in 1880, giving guests an intimate and secluded feel right in the center of bustling Old Town. A word to the wise: fully investigate all the available rooms before booking — the five different properties have distinct characteristics and room types are very specific when it comes to location, floor level, and amenities. Some of our favorite details are the red brick pathways, painted wood decking, and the abundant tropical gardens that surround the property. Keep in mind that Simonton Court is an adults-only property and because of its historic nature is not very suitable for travelers requiring ramps or other accessible features. A wander through the leafy palms will bring you to the hotel’s four pools with poolside service, bike rental area, and, on Friday and Saturday afternoons, a social happy hour with discounted drinks and free snacks. There’s also a free (albeit light) continental breakfast available, but best of all there’s no resort fee! The Details: Hyatt Centric Key West Resort & Spa Hyatt Every room has a balcony. It’s on the water, but on a seawall without a beach area. The Hyatt Centric Key West has a bullseye location when it comes to being at the heart of the action. Guests at this 120-room hotel can expect the typical Hyatt Centric experience and style that aims to mix the familiarity of a big brand with the feeling of a local boutique hotel. Rooms are comfy with the standard features, and we love that every single one has a balcony that comes with a shade cover so guests can take advantage of sunny days (note that not all have ocean views). Menus at the restaurant and bar add in local flavor and ingredients, the ocean-view pool is heated in chillier months, and there’s a nice on-site spa with tropical-leaning treatments. The daily resort fee includes fun extras like a two-hour bike rental for each guest, pool inflatables and treats, 24-hour gym access (including Peloton bikes), and off-site beach access — but doesn’t include parking. The Details: Southernmost Beach Resort Key West Southernmost Beach Resort You’ll get front-row ocean views, three pools, and free beach chairs and umbrellas at South Beach. The unpredictable Wi-Fi and early-rising resident roosters aren’t for everyone. The Southernmost Beach Resort Key West has a notable location at the end of Duval Street, just a three-minute walk to South Beach and the Southernmost Point buoy. It’s a great family-friendly option for travelers looking for a quieter Key West experience without having to sacrifice walkability. Built in 1948, this 261-room resort underwent a $15-million-dollar update to nearly all of its rooms, the exterior, lobby, and one of its pools and pool bars which was unveiled in 2022. While there are 11 different room types to choose from, they’re on the smaller side, ranging between 220 to 470 square feet. Robes, coffeemakers, welcome waters, and mini-fridges come standard with upgrades snagging extras like balconies, upgraded views, or an oceanfront location. Guests can enjoy three pools with ocean views, full service menus, live music, and adults-only tranquility, and a full-service beach club serving up food, drinks, and free beach set-ups. A note to those who like to sleep in: there are several resident roosters on the property that never take an early morning off from crowing. The Details: Alexander’s Guest House XXX You’ll get free breakfast, an excellent location, and a 24-hour pool with no resort fee. There are two clothing-optional upper sundecks on the property which may not appeal to everyone. Alexander’s Guest House is a 17-room guesthouse and one of Key West’s proudly gay-owned and -operated hotels. Originally built in 1902, this three-story conch-style house is now listed on the National List of Historic Places, but don’t let her age fool you — this gorgeous girl has immaculate style and a flawless beauty routine. Natural wood ceilings, bright white trim and paneling, matte black shutters, and loads of large windows bringing in natural light showcase architectural highlights, while stark white furniture, well-placed animal print rugs, and black and white awnings keep things looking contemporary and sophisticated. The lush tropical grounds, a 24-hour pool and spa, included breakfast, and a convenient yet quiet Old Town location make Alexander’s a popular spot, but the fact that there’s no resort fee makes it a downright gem. Another feature worth mentioning about this adults-only hotel? There’s an upper-level sun deck — and it’s clothing-optional. The Details: Know Before You Go Be wary of booking during hurricane season Key West experiences a hurricane season every year from June through November, and it’s no idle threat. The capital of the Conch Republic is one of the top five most impacted U.S. cities when it comes to hurricanes, often bearing the brunt of the season’s rains, winds, and flooding. As a former Floridian who has experienced their fair share of hurricanes, I can’t directly recommend booking a stay on this small island during hurricane season, but I can say that if you’re willing to take the gamble, room rates can be almost half-price from peak season. Keep in mind that even if there are no hurricanes, you’ll likely still experience short but heavy downpours. You don’t necessarily need a car Chances are, if you’ve got a car, you’ll park it at your hotel and that’s where it’ll stay until you’re ready to head home. Key West is so small that you can walk the main Duval strip from end-to-end in about 30 minutes if you don’t stop. For those who prefer wheels to walking, there’s also a free shuttle that travels the Duval Loop, making 16 stops along the way in about as many minutes. For anything farther off of Duval, rideshare services are affordable and readily available. The only time you’ll need to travel by car is getting to and from the airport. Key West has its own (small) airport One thing I love about Key West is that this tiny island with an area of just over four miles has its own international airport. Six airlines fly in and out of Key West — United, Delta, American, JetBlue, Allegiant, and Silver — with both year-round and seasonal routes. What I don’t love is how expensive these flights can be. It’s often more economical for many tourists to fly into Miami International Airport, rent a car, and drive the scenic 160 miles down to Key West. But time is money, so for some, it’s worth the extra price and shorter travel times. The Keys are also known as the Conch Republic While you’re there, you may see flags for the Conch Republic hung up around town, or hear people talking about “Conchs.” Long story short, in 1982, Key West staged a faux-protest against the U.S. government for causing a debilitating traffic jam along the only road out of the Keys. They declared their secession from the United States and the formation of the Conch Republic. The joke took on a life of its own with the creation of flags, passports, and fake currency, and is still talked about today. Key West is a proud LGBTQIA-friendly destination Key West is an international LGBTQIA haven, and throws one of the largest pride celebrations in the country. But, even bigger and perhaps more legendary than that is the island’s annual Fantasy Fest, a 10-day adults-only party that encourages its 75,000 attendees to let loose. It’s a quirky, creative, and queer-heavy party and everyone is invited. Even without an official event, Key West is known for being an open and accepting place, attracting over 250,000 LGBTQIA-identifying travelers every year. How We Chose These Hotels For this article, Katherine Alex Beaven sifted through the island’s best hotel offerings, keeping in mind T+L editor-loved properties and her own experience with Key West hotels during her travels to the island.

Learn more Shayne Benowitz, Contributor Forbes Vetted With its turquoise waters, white-sand beaches and vibrant community, Florida’s Key West offers the ultimate breezy tropical escape. The southernmost point of the continental U.S. has long attracted artists and writers, from Ernest Hemingway to Judy Blume. The best hotels in Key West embody this creative spirit while offering a laid-back and sophisticated slice of island life. For travelers who want to be close to Mallory Square and the bars lining Duval Street, we recommend Opal Key Resort And Marina and The Marquesa Hotel in Old Town. Families will appreciate the pools and lush grounds at Parrot Key Hotel and Villas. For those looking to live it up in luxury, Ocean Key Resort And Spa has it all. Below, the best hotels in Key West for 2024. Editor’s Picks: Best High End Resort In Key West: Ocean Key Resort And Spa A view of the Ocean Key Resort's Sunset Pier Bar Ocean Key Resort And Spa At the foot of Duval Street on the Key West Harbor, Ocean Key Resort and Spa is quintessential Key West. There’s a brilliant blue pool that mirrors the color of the ocean, the Sunset Pier bar juts out into the harbor (offering unobstructed sunset views) and the hotel offers the island’s best spa. SpaTerre specializes in Balinese and Thai treatments like a rice and turmeric skin scrub followed by a flower petal bath. The resort’s signature fine dining restaurant, Hot Tin Roof, serves an elevated take on the island’s classic “Floribbean” fare—think seared black grouper in coconut curry and crispy whole yellowtail snapper. Ocean Key Resort has a breezy beach house aesthetic with polished limestone floors, rustic wood-paneled ceilings and cool-toned turquoise and lime furnishings. As an added bonus, each of the resort’s 100 rooms and suites boast balconies with full or partial harbor views. Best Hotel In Key West Old Town: The Marquesa Hotel A Junior Suite at the Marquesa Hotel. The Marquesa Hotel A boutique hotel on Fleming Street in the heart of Old Town, The Marquesa Hotel is one of the most sophisticated lodgings on the island. With just 27 rooms inside four restored, Victorian-style conch cottages dating back to the late 1800s, it’s all charming tin roofs, pastel siding and white wrap-around balconies with lush tropical flora. Tucked away beneath palm fronds, you’ll find two secluded courtyard swimming pools. And while no two rooms are exactly alike, most are spacious with high gloss Brazilian cherry hardwood floors and a mélange of substantial, wooden furniture, sourced from the West Indies to the Philippines and England. Its on-site restaurant is widely regarded as one of the best in Key West with creative preparations of local seafood, like seared black grouper with basil blue crab and saffron aioli. Best Boutique Hotel In Key West: The Grand Maloney A room at the Grand Maloney. The Grand Maloney Since its opening in May 2022, the Grand Maloney has dazzled design lovers as one of the most stylish boutique hotels in Key West. With only five rooms and one freestanding carriage house (decked out with its own private outdoor shower), the property treats guests to an intimate stay in a Victorian-style mansion with a wraparound porch, a stately turret and a rare brick façade just a block off Duval on lovely Caroline Street. Owned by a multi-generational Key West family, the historic architecture was preserved, while the interiors have been updated with luxurious finishes and designer furniture. No two rooms are alike and some follow a color-coordinated scheme—the Red Room’s ceiling is painted fire engine red, the Yellow Room’s shower is tiled in canary yellow, etc. While there’s no restaurant onsite, the best of Key West is at your doorstep. A small courtyard swimming pool is the icing on this high-design cake. Best Hotel In Key West Near Mallory Square: Opal Key Resort And Marina Pool at Opal Key Resort And Marina. Opal Key Resort And Marina Perched at the mouth of Key West Harbor, Opal Key Resort & Marina’s waterfront promenade runs seamlessly into Mallory Square, where Key West’s nightly sunset celebration features all manner of entertainers. The resort’s marina positions travelers within steps of water sports companies that will whisk you off on snorkel excursions, sunset sails, jet ski tours and parasail adventures, as well as fishing guides for private charters. Located just a block from Duval Street’s nightlife, restaurants and entertainment, Opal is as centrally located as it gets. The 178 guest rooms and suites are spacious, ranging from single rooms to three-bedroom suites, featuring balconies overlooking the harbor or courtyard swimming pool, while the on-site restaurant offers seating directly on the marina, as well as an elevated rooftop bar for some of the best sunset views in town. Best Value Hotel In Key West: NYAH Key West Bunk room at NYAH Key West. NYAH Key West An acronym for Not Your Average Hotel, NYAH Key West lives up to its name. Housed inside a compound of conch cottages in the traditional Victorian style with tin roofs and white balconies, NYAH oozes Old Key West charm. The novelty comes with NYAH’s flexible guest rooms, which can sleep up to six adults in twin bunk beds. While strictly no frills, rooms are clean and functional, with a private bathroom, mini fridge and individual lockers; and beds are surprisingly comfortable, each with its own night-light and charging station. A spacious central courtyard in red brick is home to three small swimming pools and a hot tub encircled by lush, green foliage providing ample space to relax and soak up the sun. Situated within a block of the Historic Seaport and a short walk to Duval Street, the area’s residential charm with pastel conch cottages and quaint cafes, restaurants and art galleries offers up the magic sought from a Key West vacation. Best Hotel For Families In Key West: Parrot Key Hotel And Villas Exterior of Parrot Key Hotel And Villas. Parrot Key Hotel And Villas Tucked away in a corner of New Town overlooking the Florida Bay on the island’s northern side, Parrot Key Hotel & Villas has the feeling of its own private paradise. And while you’re a solid 10 to 15 minutes to the attractions of Old Town (by complimentary shuttle), you won’t mind the slightly isolated location once you surrender to Parrot Key’s luxurious, tropical environs. Among its 148 spacious guest rooms are suites and villas that range from one- to three-bedrooms, it makes for a perfect family getaway. With four swimming pools and a waterfront white sand terrace with hammocks and lounges, there’s plenty of space to spread out for play or relaxation. The open-air Grove Kitchen & Bar anchors the resort with fresh Keys classics, from conch fritters and ceviche and locally caught fish. Best Hotel In Key West For Couples: The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection King room balcony facing the pool at The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection. The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection Embodying its sexy slogan, “Play naughty, sleep saintly,” this Autograph Collection hotel in Old Town is perfect for couples who value a fun atmosphere as much as a restful room. Steps from Duval Street, the location is unbeatable for travelers looking to be close to the action—but there’s plenty to love on-property, too. The interiors are sultry yet streamlined, with each of the 36 guest rooms featuring the hotel’s signature nautical color scheme with blue LED lighting and sheer drapes for a boudoir-inspired touch. We’re partial to the ground-floor King rooms with balconies that open onto the tranquil infinity pool in the courtyard. A rollicking rooftop bar offers live music and the on-site restaurant, Tempt, is a hot spot for delicious happy hour cocktails and late-night bites. Despite all the action, the hotel is blissfully quiet in the evening, making it a perfect respite after some fun on the strip. Best Hotel In Key West Near The Seaport: The Marker Key West Harbor Resort A patio view at the Marker Hotel in Key West, FL. The Marker Key West Harbor Resort The design of the Marker, on Key West’s Historic Seaport, succeeds in bringing the watery hues and breezy style of Key West indoors. Its 96 large, modern guest rooms have bright blue blankets, water-reminiscent carpets and crisp white walls and linens. Most rooms have balconies for soaking in Key West’s balmy ocean breeze. For full water immersion, book a Harbor View room which offers views of sailboats bobbing in the sea. The hotel truly offers the best of Key West from the iconic architecture (tin roofs and white porticos) to the climate-appropriate cuisine—including fish tacos and a key lime colada. Don't miss the property's calendar of events, from live music to morning yoga classes. Best Private Island Hotel In Key West: Sunset Key Cottages A beachfront view from Sunset Key Cottages in Key West, FL. Sunset Key Cottages If your idea of island living includes a more quiet residential feel, pass over Key West’s Old Town and book one of 40 cottages at Sunset Key. The hotel on 27-acre Sunset Key Island, a ferry ride away from Key West, is the Key’s most exclusive destination. Guests can laze the day away on the hotel’s private beach, work up a sweat on the tennis court and cool off with a dip in the lagoon-style swimming pool. Cottages, ranging from one- to four-bedrooms, have wraparound porches and balconies, wooden bed frames and full kitchens with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances. Some cottages even boast private pools. Make a golden-hour reservation at Latitudes restaurant for a meal of fresh fish paired with nature’s stunning sunset show. Best Beachfront Hotel In Key West: Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection By Hilton The walkway leading to the swimming pools and beach for guests. Casa Marina Key West, Curio Collection By Hilton Oil tycoon Henry Flagler, who also built the Overseas Railroad connecting Key West to the mainland, created the Mediterranean Revival-style Casa Marina. With 6.5 oceanfront acres, stucco arcades and a Spanish tile roof, the resort on the National Register of Historic Places channels the glamour of the Roaring Twenties. The hotel officially opened on New Year’s Eve 1920 and has been a favorite of celebrities and visiting dignitaries ever since. The high-ceilinged lobby has Cypress wood beams and columns and glossy hardwood floors. And while guest rooms with neutral contemporary furnishings are a bit basic for such an opulent historic structure, all is forgiven at the elaborate poolscape where two symmetric pools flank a wide walkway leading to the 1,000-foot-long soft sand beach reserved exclusively for guests. Best Historic Hotel In Key West: The Mansion On The Sea Exterior of The Mansion On The Sea. The Mansion On The Sea The ornate sea foam green and conch shell pink Victorian mansion at the southern end of Duval Street is the historic Mansion on the Sea, originally built as a private residence in 1897. Today, it’s home to 18 unique guest rooms and a sublime zero-entry infinity pool dotted with hammocks leading to an oceanfront sun deck. Over the years, the mansion’s hosted everyone from Ernest Hemingway to Leonard Bernstein and John F. Kennedy, and you’ll find ephemera from its long history throughout the lobby, including one of Thomas Edison’s original phonographs. Every guest room has its own unique layout and design, many decked out with four-poster beds and original art. The poolside bar is a great gathering place for cocktails and lobster pizza, and the mansion also provides a complimentary continental breakfast. Best Off-The-Beaten-Path Hotel In Key West: The Perry Hotel And Marina A room with a view at the Perry Hotel. The Perry Hotel And Marina Separated from Key West by the narrow Cow Key Channel, Stock Island is the area’s last working waterfront and feels more industrial than the rest of Key West. The Perry Hotel and Marina, which opened in 2017, gives travelers unprecedented access to this slice of “old Key West” where longtime Keys families, fishermen and artists reside. There’s nothing old-timey about the clean-lined hotel with plenty of raw concrete, exposed steel and natural wood. With its location in Stock Island Marina Village, fishing and boating charter possibilities are endless. The hotel’s excellent Matt’s Stock Island Kitchen and Bar (where fresh seafood featured in dishes like cioppino and shrimp and grits comes directly from the working boats on the waterfront) is worth visiting even if you’re not staying at the hotel. Hotel guests can also lounge by the waterfront pool and sip a cocktail by the fire pits at sunset. Best Pet-Friendly Hotel In Key West: Winslow's Bungalows The exterior of Winslow's Bungalows. Winslow's Bungalows Part of the Key West Historic Inns collection, Winslow’s Bungalows offers travelers a dog-friendly oasis in the heart of Old Town. With several quaint white-washed bungalows connected by lushly landscaped walkways, the property exudes classic Key West charm. Guests staying with four-legged friends will appreciate the spacious rooms with private patios, which are perfect for lounging outdoors while enjoying tropical foliage views. While the property dates back to 1856, its 85 guest rooms have been meticulously updated with plush king beds, spa-like bathrooms and modern tropical décor. Roll out a yoga mat, grab a drink by the poolside bar or take your furry friend for a stroll down nearby Duval Street. While there’s no onsite restaurant, the hotel offers a complimentary breakfast and there are plenty of dog-friendly restaurants nearby. Why Trust Forbes Vetted About Shayne Benowitz, Your Key West Guide Before I launched my career in journalism and travel writing over a decade ago, I worked for a water sports company in Key West and spent my days taking passengers snorkeling at the reef, sunset sailing and parasailing.
