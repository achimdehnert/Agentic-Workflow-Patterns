If you purchase something through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you need convincing that the Big Peach loves luxury, just look at the best hotels in Atlanta. Brands such as St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton dot the landscape, joined by motivated independent boltholes like Stonehurst Place where original Warhols hang above 19th-century fireplaces. But luxury doesn’t have to be straight-laced: Even at the Four Seasons, the lounge spins vintage records and serves cocktails with names like Dynamite Stick. Then there's the Hotel Clermont, which is truly unlike anything else in the city. Read on for our picks for the best hotels in Atlanta, where luxury is always paired with Southern hospitality. Read our complete Atlanta travel guide here, which includes: Every hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. This story has been updated with new information since its original publish date. Loews AtlantaArrow Set on Atlanta’s Midtown Mile—one of the hottest stretches of town—Loews Atlanta is a short walk from Piedmont Park and the Beltline, the Fox Theatre, and the High Museum of Art. The lobby's soaring ceilings and granite-and-marble floors echo with the voices of museum- and theater-goers, families, and young, trendy types. The beds beg to be snoozed in, thanks to their 300-thread-count Egyptian-cotton linens. The vibe is contemporary, with an upholstered headboard and some artwork. In the bathroom, there's a walk-in shower with a separate soaking tub and a flat-screen TV. Perks like an Exhale Spa and restaurants serving locally sourced cuisine—not to mention a recent $13 million renovation that of the lobby, bar, guest rooms, and corridors—round out a superb stay here. The Candler Hotel Atlanta, Curio Collection by HiltonArrow When Coca-Cola founder and former Atlanta Mayor Asa Griggs Candler built this property in the early twentieth century, it was the city’s tallest building. (The bank vault in the basement is rumored to be his hiding spot for the Coca-Cola formula.) Before opening as a hotel in 2019, the property served as office space, and turning it into lodging—all while preserving the original floor plan and thus its National Register designation—took nearly four years. Entering the lobby, the sweeping marble staircase with original reliefs immediately catches the eye (you just don’t see architectural details like that anymore), followed by the colorful Tiffany windows. This is a place where the treasures of the old have been painstakingly preserved, even as the new has been ushered in. It’s an easy stroll to Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and the World of Coca-Cola. Easily the city’s most historic stay, this meticulously renovated property lets you sleep in a key location from Atlanta’s story. The Ritz-Carlton, AtlantaArrow Want to stay in downtown Atlanta? This may be one of the priciest options, but it's among the best. The Ritz is near it all: a short walk to the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, the College Football Hall of Fame, and the Center for Civil and Human Rights. The lobby sets a mod-glam mood, where contemporary art hangs above white leather chairs. Tuesdays through Saturdays, live music spills out of Lumen, the lobby bar, and there’s always a line for espresso at Jittery Joe’s, Atlanta’s only outpost of the beloved Georgia coffee company, located near the front desk. Deluxe Rooms are the standard room category, with a marble foyer that leads to one or two beds covered in 400-thread-count Fritte linens. The 30-page-long room-service menu has build-your-own salads (toppings include shaved fennel and local goat cheese), steak tartare, and vanilla bean crème brulee. Which means there’s absolutely no reason to go to bed hungry here. Beautifully designed, with top-notch service and terrific food and drinks, this hotel is worth the splurge. The Ritz-Carlton Reynolds, Lake OconeeArrow On the shores of Lake Oconee, some 80 miles east of Atlanta, the Ritz-Carlton Reynolds, offers an easy escape from city life. The main resort overlooks 30 miles of shoreline with a small beach, floating hammocks, and a dock with stand-up paddle boards and kayaks. Tall Georgia pines frame rolling lawns, and fire pits crackle at dusk. This is a place that makes you want to put your phone in the safe and unplug for a while. Accommodations vary widely, from 463-square-foot standard rooms to a 5,404-square-foot Lake House, including brand new Fireside Rooms with personal fire pits. Worth a trip in itself, the resort’s recently renovated sprawling spa overlooks the lake and offers everything from a simple men’s shave to a full-body scrub utilizing Georgia red clay. On sunny days, the pool deck is the place to be, and there are two to choose from. Golf, spa, swim, or simply lie in the sun; no matter how you fill your days, you’ll no doubt leave refreshed. The St. Regis AtlantaArrow St. Regis Atlanta is one of those hotels that stays busy all day with guests—and locals—heading to and from the spa, restaurants, and bar. You can hang by the Pool Piazza and read a magazine, get a tension-reducing treatment at the Remède Spa, grab one of their "famous Bloody Marys" at the St. Regis Bar, arguably the most popular hotel bar in Atlanta, and even watch the hotel sommelier open a bottle of champagne by saber. (It’s a nightly tradition that traces its roots to Napoleon and was ritualized some years ago at the St. Regis New York.) We haven't even mentioned the hotel’s on-site restaurant, Atlas, with bold American cuisine served in a room with original works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Chagall, and Matisse (from owner Joe Lewis’s private collection). It was one of only a handful of restaurants to receive one Michelin star (which is why it books up quickly). Four Seasons Hotel AtlantaArrow Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta is in the heart of Midtown, just a half-mile from the Renzo Piano–designed High Museum of Art and steps from sprawling Piedmont Park. Entering the 53-floor neoclassical building is a joy unto itself, with its marble grand staircase leading up to rooms with memorable views of the city skyline. Despite its opulence, the hotel is far from hushed: Friday and Saturday nights, a DJ in the bar spins something funky, and on Sundays, live music from Park 75 restaurant can be heard throughout the main floor. Keep an eye out for celebrities—Atlanta’s first five-star hotel has seen the likes of Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, and other famous folks. You’ll also see plenty of well-heeled business travelers. On weekends, wedding-goers take over the lobby lounge into the wee hours. From its central location to its gorgeous décor and groovy cocktail lounge, this hotel does not disappoint. Waldorf Astoria Atlanta BuckheadArrow Rising 42 stories over Buckhead, the Waldorf Astoria (until fairly recently a Mandarin Oriental) is a local landmark designed by famed architect Robert A.M. Stern. The stark limestone and cast-stone facade is softened by a formal English garden in the back courtyard. In the marble lobby, take note of contemporary art by Atlantan Claire Chambless. Capitalizing on Atlanta’s reputation as a “city in the forest,” the hotel recently rolled out a new spa concept aimed at giving guests a sense of calm. Treatments include Forest Therapy, which incorporates evergreen, cypress, and juniper essential oils in a full-body massage—including a scalp massage. The elegant, neutral-hued furnishings in the bedrooms are nice, but the real highlight are the deep soaking tubs in the white-marble bathrooms. Come for the service, stay for the spa, return for the private balconies. Hotel ClermontArrow Driving down Ponce de Leon Avenue, Hotel Clermont isn’t difficult to spot. The six-story, century-old brick building is topped with a sixty-five-foot radio tower bearing the Clermont name—an original relic that came down years ago but was proudly resurrected at the hotel’s splashy grand opening in 2018. At the check-in desk, you’ll be greeted with a free cold PBR, a tribute to the can-crushing dexterity of the notorious Blondie, who works the legendary lounge downstairs. Accommodations range from roomy suites to double-bunk rooms—nodding to the ones once favored by traveling bands staying at the Clermont Motor Lodge. Velvet headboards, lightbulb sconces, and record players add vintage appeal, and moody portraits by Atlanta College of Art graduate Sharon Shapiro were inspired by the Clermont Lounge dancers. The Hotel Clermont caters to a decidedly discriminating crowd, thanks to its top-notch service, upscale amenities, and celebrated restaurant. The Hamilton Alpharetta, Curio Collection by HiltonArrow Alpharetta, about half-hour north of Atlanta, has become a cool suburb in recent years with a flourishing downtown packed with great restaurants, boutiques, green-spaces, and a Ameris Bank Amphitheatre which draws big names performers. Dark and moody is the vibe of the Hamilton’s guest rooms. Dark blue and grey accents create a cozy setting to unwind. Large windows (some rooms have floor-to-ceiling) give a glimpse of charming Alpharetta. You have everything you need right outside the hotel in picturesque Alpharetta which comprises a blend of historic buildings and new construction that fits in seamlessly. And you will truly have your pick of excellent dining options within walking distance. There’s also a high-energy green space where kids frolic and friends play corn hole, and a free splash pad’s nearby when the heat runs too high. It doesn’t get better than this in the suburbs. Hotel Granada MidtownArrow Spanish architecture-meets-Southern charm in this Midtown hotel with a lush courtyard and cozy rooms. Hotel Granada is an adaptive reuse project set in a century-old building that once housed apartments. Located on the northern end of Midtown, the hotel attracts a fun-loving crowd that wants to sip spritzes under the crape myrtles at Pom Court, the courtyard restaurant, while modern steel structures tower above. This hotel’s perfect for those who want access to Midtown’s museums (the High and MODA) and other Midtown conveniences without the sterility of a box hotel. The hotel sits on a quieter stretch of Midtown with close proximity to the High Museum of Art and the Woodruff Arts Center, home to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Low-rise residential buildings and bungalows mingle with high-rises here, making for plenty of architectural eye-candy to enjoy on a neighborhood stroll. It’s also not far from Colonial Square which houses a food hall, Italian restaurant Serena Pastificio, and JoJo’s Beloved Cocktail Lounge. Kimpton Sylvan HotelArrow With a timeless Mid-Century Modern aesthetic throughout the hotel, you quickly forget that the most frenetic parts of Buckhead are just a few blocks away. Staying here is a convenient option if you have business to tend to in the area or plan to do some serious shopping at one of the nearby shopping destinations. It’s also just downright charming. The hotel holds 217-rooms but it feels more intimate with plenty of nooks to hide out in, whether that’s the lobby, the outdoor pool, or the rooftop bar (which becomes revelrous at night, especially on the weekends). You’re likely to find a diverse crowd, with ladies dressed in outfits fit for the ‘gram, couples canoodling in the booths of Betty (the supper club), and girlfriends chatting it up over drinks on the roof. You’re just a few blocks away from Buckhead Village, however, known for its designer shops and high-end dining options like Brush Sushi and Carmel. Signia by Hilton Atlanta Georgia World Congress CenterArrow This recently opened Hilton brings a touch of glam to downtown Atlanta. It’s conveniently situated next to the Georgia World Congress Center (the site of many conventions) and the Mercedes-Benz Stadium which is ideal for sports fans and concert goers— you’re likely to see a mix of both if you stay here. It’s a large hotel with nearly 1000 rooms and tons of meeting spaces, so it caters to a lot of business people, but you’ll also see posh locals strolling in for dinner at the hotel’s restaurants, including Capolinea and Nest on Four (a sports bar). It’s hard to miss the beautiful art on display while walking around, but just in case, this is your heads up. There are more than 70 pieces of art on display throughout the property, ranging from larger-than-life sculptures hanging overhead to paintings gracing the walls—it’s kind of like an onsite museum experience. The hotel even has a floor-by-floor guide to make sure you don’t miss anything.

These 100 Hotels Were Voted Best in the World by T+L Readers — and 16 of Them Are in the U.S. Hotels in Asia, India, and the United States got the most attention from T+L readers in the annual “World’s Best Awards” survey for 2024. Paul Brady is the news director at Travel + Leisure and the brand's expert on cruise travel. He has been covering the travel industry for more than 15 years for outlets including Condé Nast Traveler, Skift, and The Huffington Post. Travel + Leisure readers are going global. In this year’s World’s Best Awards, readers’ favorite hotels span far and wide, with 38 countries making an appearance on the 2024 list. Properties in destinations like India and Southeast Asia are among the highest scorers this year, along with 16 stellar U.S. properties. At each hotel, voters were wowed by the style and the service of the top 100: Every winner scored higher than 97 on our 100-point survey. Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts How Voting Works Every year for our World's Best Awards survey, T+L asks readers to weigh in on travel experiences around the globe — to share their opinions on the top hotels, resorts, cities, islands, cruise ships, spas, airlines, and more. Over 186,000 T+L readers completed the 2024 survey. A total of more than 700,000 votes were cast across over 8,700 properties (hotels, cities, cruise lines, etc.). Hotels were classified as either resort hotel, city hotel, inn, or safari lodge based on their location and amenities, and they were specifically rated on the criteria below: For each characteristic, respondents could choose a rating of excellent, above average, average, below average, or poor. The final scores are averages of these responses. What Readers Loved T+L readers traveled off the beaten path this past year. Each of the top 10 properties is located in a different country, from Spain to Qatar to Mexico. In Europe, England had four properties in the top 100, while France, Italy, and Spain each had two. Thirteen safari lodges and resorts caught our readers’ attention in Kenya, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The highlights of some of these stays? Readers mentioned chimpanzee tracking, private game drives, and accommodations so close to the action, they could hear the animals. Those craving a calmer getaway found what they were looking for in villas next to white-sand beaches and crystal blue seas. The Maldives and the Indonesian island of Bali were particularly popular, with four and six hotels, respectively, in the top 100. While each winning property has its own allure — from an underwater restaurant at one property to pro surfers-turned-coaches at another — all these escapes offered voters the satisfaction of pure isolation without skimping on service. For all the international adventure, T+L readers spent time exploring the United States, too, which has 16 properties on this year’s list. California has the most properties in the U.S. in the top 100, with four seaside hotels in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Newport Beach, Oceanside, and Sausalito. And the East Coast received some love, in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, and South Carolina. Below, find a full rundown of the top 100 hotels in the world, as voted by T+L readers. The Full List 1. The Oberoi Rajvilas, Jaipur: Jaipur, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts Maybe it’s the peacocks that roam the grounds, or maybe it’s the sumptuous rooms — many with private gardens and plunge pools — that put this luxurious retreat over the top. Readers simply can’t get enough of this world-class hotel in one of India’s most alluring cities. “Truly magical — a beautiful property and a very serene oasis,” said one voter. “An amazing experience,” agreed another. The impeccably manicured gardens play host to morning yoga classes, while there’s a full lineup of treatments at the guests-only spa. The most enticing element of a stay, though, may be the sense of calm with which the staff of the Oberoi Rajvilas carry themselves — and pass on to their appreciative guests. Reader Score: 99.79 2. La Casa de la Playa: Playa del Carmen, Mexico Courtesy of La Casa de la Playa A close second in reader voting, this Playa del Carmen hideaway is a 63-room boutique hotel that feels super-exclusive while also offering access to all the amenities of the Grupo Xcaret development. Experiences on- and off-property are all handled by the in-house team; a Virgilio Martinéz restaurant is a particular dining highlight. Reader Score: 99.76 3. The Ritz-Carlton, Doha: Doha, Qatar Courtesy of The RItz-Carlton, Doha Hidden away on a small, exclusive island near the city’s Pearl Island development, this family-friendly five-star has what one voter calls “some of the best service and facilities in Qatar,” including several restaurants, pools, views of Persian Gulf, and a private beach. The fitness facilities — including racquet-sports courts — wowed voters, too. Reader Score: 99.64 4. Park Hyatt Siem Reap: Siem Reap, Cambodia Courtesy of Park Hyatt Siem Reap A legendary luxury property designed by the prolific Bill Bensley, the Park Hyatt is a richly appointed option on the way to Angkor Wat. “Lovely and authentic hospitality, consistent service, and friendly staff, with excellent food,” said one reader, who also appreciated the property’s two swimming pools. Reader Score: 99.40 5. Selman Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of Selman Marrakech A Marrakesh classic, the Selman is famous for its collection of Arabian horses, which occasionally parade around the gardens to the delight of guests. But the Jacques Garcia–designed resort is anything but a one-trick pony: its 60 rooms, suites, and villas are some of the city’s most glamorous, and a Chenot spa has almost every biohacking treatment imaginable. Reader Score: 99.39 6. Gran Hotel Mas d'en Bruno: Torroja del Priorat, Spain Courtesy of Gran Hotel Mas d'en Bruno Opened in 2023 in the burgeoning Spanish wine region of Priorat, this new Relais & Châteaux retreat with just 24 rooms has major culinary ambitions at its main restaurant, Vinum. “They are making amazing meals, with the best products the region has to offer, without being pretentious,” said one voter, who also raved about the “beautiful views and utter peace and quiet” at the hotel. Reader Score: 99.33 7. Regent Hong Kong: Hong Kong, China Courtrsy of Regent Hong Kong A new global flagship for the refreshed Regent brand, this 497-room Hong Kong hotel was years in the making. The wait, voters said, was worth it for this luxurious perch along the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade. The seven on-site restaurants, including the two Michelin star Lai Ching Heen, also impressed readers. Reader Score: 99.33 8. Pendry Newport Beach: Newport Beach, California Courtesy of Pendry Newport Beach Opened last fall with a celebrity-filled party, this property marks the third in Southern California for Pendry, a brand that prides itself on exceptional service in boutique spaces. The 20-story hotel has injected new life into the Newport Beach social scene with a private members' club, a swanky lounge with live music, and several luxe dining options. Reader Score: 99.29 9. (tie) Alma Resort: Cam Ranh, Vietnam Courtesy of Alma Resort Oceanfront Alma, on the Cam Ranh Peninsula just south of Nha Trang, Vietnam, is a full-featured beach resort with 12 pools, 14 restaurants and bars, plenty of kid-friendly activities, a spacious spa — and even an on-property farm from which many ingredients are sourced. Reader Score: 99.20 9. (tie) Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi: South Malé Atoll, Maldives Athul Prasad The top-scoring Maldives property on this year’s list, the Waldorf Astoria is a study in maximalist luxury. “It was an unforgettable experience,” said one respondent, summing up the vibe among voters. While the main resort has plenty to offer, the most eye-catching feature of the Waldorf Astoria may be its private island, an exclusive escape with room for up to 24 guests — and a nightly price tag approaching six figures. Reader Score: 99.20 11. Mission Pacific Beach Resort: Oceanside, California Courtesy of Mission Pacific Beach Resort Winning in three separate categories this year, including No. 1 for best California resort and continental U.S. resort, respectively, this beachside property is more than just California cool. It features private balconies with beach views, a Michelin-starred restaurant, and the original bungalow featured in Top Gun. Reader Score: 99.17 12. Argos in Cappadocia: Turkey, Cappadocia Courtesy of Argos in Cappadocia While new to the World’s Best Awards, this site is anything but, as it’s located in one of the oldest and largest monasteries in the world, built from traditional Turkish stones, wood, and handicrafts. Taste “food beyond imagination,” according to one reader, at on-site Nahita (or sip from one of the cellar’s 70,000 bottles), get a massage overlooking Mount Erciyes and Pigeon Valley, or explore centuries-old underground tunnels beneath the hotel, too. Reader Score: 99.09 12. Capella Ubud: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of Capella Ubud, Bali It’s been described as “a tropical fever dream of tented suites,” a place that was, in 2020, named the best hotel in the world by T+L readers. These days, it remains a highly regarded resort, thanks to its secluded setting in the upland forests near the town of Ubud and enchanting, antiques-filled spaces that feel like nothing else in the world. Reader Score: 99.09 14. Raffles The Palm Dubai: Dubai, United Arab Emirates Courtesy of Raffles The Palm Dubai In signature Raffles fashion, this property from the luxe hotel brand — its first in the Middle East — brings extravagant amenities and glamor to already-bustling Dubai. Take its 6,000 Swarovski Crystal chandeliers or the 80-seat private movie theater on property. And the brand’s acclaimed 24-hour personalized butler service is a highlight for guests, too. Reader Score: 99.08 15. Six Senses Fort Barwara: Rajasthan, India Aparna Jayakumar “A dazzling concoction of new and old,” this stunning palace hotel, which appeared on the May 2022 cover of T+L, occupies some buildings that date back 700 years, not far from India’s Ranthambore National Park. Now part of wellness-oriented Six Senses, the 48-suite resort has a 30,000-square-foot spa and an Ayurvedic practitioner on call. Reader Score: 99.06 16. The Winnetu Oceanside Resort: Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts Courtesy of The Winnetu Oceanside Resort This family-owned property on Martha’s Vineyard gets attention for its “great location” — spanning 11 acres of private beach — outstanding family programming, and menu options at The Dunes restaurant, according to our readers. So it’s no wonder that it took the No. 1 spot on our Best New England Resorts list this year. Reader Score: 99.00 17. Anantara Kihavah Maldives Resort: Baa Atoll, Maldives Courtesy of Minor Hotels A collection of 80 villas and multi-bedroom “residences,” the only Anantara resort to make this list distinguishes itself with an impressive array of activities and amenities, including an underwater restaurant, a celestial observatory, and a kids’ club. Reader Score: 98.95 18. La Mamounia Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of La Mamounia Marrakech The legendary hotel recently celebrated 100 years, and its next century is looking bright, thanks to a recent refurb that spruced up public spaces while adding a 20-seat cinema, a semi-secret wine bar, and a South Asian restaurant from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Reader Score: 98.94 19. Tierra Atacama: San Pedro de Atacama, Chile Courtesy of Tierra Atacama One of the three lodges operated by Chile-based Tierra Hotels, this intimate all-inclusive in the heart of the country’s northern desert is a go-to for stargazers, bird watchers, and adventurers. While this hotel is currently under renovation as of April 1, 2024, you can make a reservation now for March 2025 and beyond. Reader Score: 98.93 20. The Mulia: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The Mulia This beachfront, idyllic escape in the Nusa Dua resort area is a perfect combination “ of luxury and relaxation,” according to one reader. From private butler services to suites with Jacuzzi-equipped balconies, the Mulia ensures first-class service worth talking about when you return home. Reader Score: 98.92 21. Monwana Game Lodge: Thornybush Nature Reserve, South Africa Courtesy of MORE Family Collection Home to the Big Five in Greater Kruger National Park, this property is described by one reader as “an oasis in the bush.” From the intimate, six spacious suites to private butler service and a dedicated game-viewing team, it’s no wonder Monwana also took home the No. 1 spot for our readers’ favorite Africa safari lodges. Reader Score: 98.90 22. Joali Maldives: Raa Atoll, Maldives Courtesy of JOALI A soulful resort with a particular focus on the arts, this 73-villa resort has site-specific works, interactive exhibits, studio classes, and a gorgeous boutique — as well as all the traditional luxury trappings, including on-the-water activities, several dining options, and a high-end spa. Reader Score: 98.88 23. Nihi Sumba: Sumba, Indonesia Georg Schorschal/Courtesy of NIHI Sumba Located in Eastern Indonesia, this legendary resort retains many of the same draws that made it a must-visit when it first opened, as Nihiwatu, in 2001: surf, sand, splendid isolation. In 2016 and 2017, readers ranked it the No. 1 hotel in the world. Today, it remains a 27-villa paragon of barefoot luxury — and of philanthropy, by way of the Sumba Foundation, which supports the surrounding community. Reader Score: 98.85 24. Hotel Hartness: Greenville, South Carolina Courtesy of Hotel Hartness Just about a year after opening its doors, this 73-suite, family-owned hotel in Greenville is now the No. 1 best resort in South Carolina. Inspired by the design of the Hartness family’s own home, the property is modern yet welcoming, featuring a full-service spa and two dining options. Reader Score: 98.80 24. Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Goa: Goa, India Courtesy of Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Goa Concealed in the greenery on the edge of Radhanagar Beach, this 46-acre property in India’s remote Andaman Islands doesn’t need to advertise its seclusion. The raised villas — an homage to the traditional homes of local Indigenous communities — and three dining options supplied by the on-site organic garden are just two reasons why this Taj dream made the 2024 list. Reader Score: 98.80 26. The Peninsula Istanbul: Istanbul, Turkey Emre Dorter/Courtesy of The Peninsula Hotels The new Peninsula hotel, which opened in February 2023, occupies a series of historic — and now beautifully refurbished — buildings along the Bosphorus. “The crisp service, the walkable location, and the top-tier amenities give it an edge,” wrote editor-in-chief Jacqui Gifford in her recent rave review, a sentiment shared by WBA voters. Reader Score: 98.77 27. (tie) The Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra: Agra, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts One of the most enchanting resorts in India, the Amarvilas overlooks the Taj Mahal, a short walk away. Views of the famed mausoleum aside, the property also impresses with its manicured gardens, lovely swimming pool, and fantastic cuisine — not to mention a peaceful terrace that’s the perfect spot for a sundowner. Reader Score: 98.74 27. (tie) The St. Regis Bali Resort: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The St. Regis Bali Resort On the shores of Nusa Dua Beach is an escape in the jungle. Guests can stay in a garden-view suite, with the sound of waves streaming through the windows, or one of the 41 villas featuring private pools and outdoor lounge areas.
