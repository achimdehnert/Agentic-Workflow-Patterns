Early life and education Davis was born on August 11, 1965, in St. Matthews, South Carolina,[7] to Mae Alice Davis (née Logan) and Dan Davis.[8][9][10] She was born on her grandmother's farm on the Singleton Plantation.[11] Her father was a horse trainer, and her mother was a maid, factory worker and homemaker.[12][13][14] She is the second youngest of six children, having four sisters and a brother.[15] Soon after she was born, her parents moved with Davis and two of her older siblings to Central Falls, Rhode Island, leaving her other siblings with her grandparents.[10] Her mother was also an activist during the Civil Rights Movement.[14] When she was two years old, Davis was taken to jail with her mother after she was arrested during a civil rights protest.[16] She has described herself as having "lived in abject poverty and dysfunction" during her childhood,[17] recalling living in "rat-infested and condemned" apartments.[18] Davis is a second cousin of actor Mike Colter, known for portraying the Marvel Comics character Luke Cage.[19] Davis attended Central Falls High School, the alma mater to which she partially credits her love of stage acting with her involvement in the arts.[20] As a teenager, she was involved in the federal TRIO Upward Bound and TRIO Student Support Services programs.[21] While enrolled at the Young People's School for the Performing Arts in West Warwick, Rhode Island, Davis's talent was recognized by a director at the program, Bernard Masterson.[22] After graduating from high school, Davis studied at Rhode Island College, majoring in theater and participating in the National Student Exchange before graduating in 1988. Next, she attended the Juilliard School for four years,[13][14] and was a member of the school's Drama Division "Group 22" (1989–93).[23] Career Early work and breakthrough on stage (1992–1999) In 1992, Davis starred in her first professional stage role, an off Broadway production of William Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It as Denis alongside Elizabeth McGovern at the Delacorte Theatre. In 1996, Davis made her Broadway debut in the original Broadway production of August Wilson's Seven Guitars as the Vera, alongside Keith David. The play opened on Broadway on March 6 at the Walter Kerr Theatre. She earned critical praise for her performance.[24][25] That same year, Davis received her Screen Actors Guild card in 1996 for doing one day of work, playing a nurse who passes a vial of blood to future How to Get Away with Murder co-star Timothy Hutton in the film The Substance of Fire (1996). She was paid $518.[26] Davis continued acting off Broadway in various productions, and appeared in bit parts on television including episodes of NYPD Blue (1996), and New York Undercover (1996). She also appeared in the HBO television military comedy film, The Pentagon Wars (1996) starring Kelsey Grammer, and Cary Elwes. In 1998, she played a small role in Steven Soderbergh's crime comedy film Out of Sight (1999). Film breakthrough and further stage success (2000–2010) In 2001, she returned to the Broadway stage in another play by August Wilson titled King Hedley II, portraying Tonya, a "35-year-old mother fighting eloquently for the right to abort a pregnancy." Her performance earned critical attention, and she received her first Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play and a Drama Desk Award.[27] She won another Drama Desk Award for her work in a 2004 off-Broadway production of Intimate Apparel by Lynn Nottage. Throughout the early 2000s Davis appeared in numerous films, including Soderbergh's Solaris and Traffic, as well as George Clooney's Syriana (2005), which Soderbergh produced. Hers was the uncredited voice of the parole board interrogator who questions Danny Ocean (Clooney) in the first scene in Ocean's Eleven (2001).[28] She also gave brief performances in the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold (2001) and the drama Antwone Fisher (2002). She also played secondary roles in Todd Haynes' costume drama Far From Heaven (2002), starring Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid. Her television work includes a recurring role in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,[29] starring roles in two short-lived series, Traveler and Century City,[30] and a special guest appearance in a Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode entitled "Badge".[31] In 2005 and 2006, Davis began a recurring role opposite Tom Selleck in a series of films made for television based on novels by Robert B. Parker, Jesse Stone: Stone Cold, Jesse Stone: Night Passage and Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise. In 2008, Davis played Mrs. Miller in the film adaptation of the Broadway play by John Patrick Shanley, Doubt, with Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. Though Davis had only a few scenes in the film, she remained a highlight of the film with noted film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times specifically praising her performance writing, "It lasts about 10 minutes, but it is the emotional heart and soul of Doubt, and if Viola Davis isn't nominated by the Academy, an injustice will have been done." Ebert would further go on to write, "She goes face to face with the pre-eminent film actress of this generation, and it is a confrontation of two equals that generates terrifying power."[32][33] She was nominated for several awards for her performance, including the Screen Actors Guild Award, the Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[34] On June 30, 2009, Davis was inducted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[35] In 2010, Davis returned to Broadway in her third August Wilson play, this time a revival of Fences as Rose Maxson, acting alongside Denzel Washington. Her performance received raves from critics in particular theatre critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times who described Davis' performance as "extraordinary", adding "Ms. Davis, who won a Tony for her performance in Wilson's King Hedley II, may well pick up another for her work here. Her face is a poignant paradox, both bone-tired and suffused with sensual radiance."[36] On June 13, 2010, Davis won her second Tony Award for her performance.[37] She was the second African-American to win the Tony for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play, after Phylicia Rashad.[citation needed] In 2010 Davis had small roles in the romantic comedy thriller Knight and Day starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz and the romantic comedy Eat Pray Love starring Julia Roberts. That same year she also played the role of Dr. Minerva in It's Kind of a Funny Story (2010), a coming-of-age film written and directed by Anna Boden with Ryan Fleck, adapted from the 2006 novel by Ned Vizzini.[38] Worldwide recognition and continued acclaim (2011–2016) In August 2011, Davis starred as Aibileen Clark, a housemaid in 1960s Mississippi, in the film adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's novel The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, and co-starring alongside Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jessica Chastain.[39] Davis described her performance in the film as channeling her mother and grandmother saying, "I feel like I brought my mom to life; I've channeled her spirit. I channeled the spirit of my grandmother, and I've kind of paid homage to how they've contributed to my life and the lives of so many people".[39] She has since expressed deep regret over taking on the role; although she still admires the people she worked with, she does not think the story or portrayal is truthful about the lives of the black characters.[40] Davis gained praise for her work and eventually won two Screen Actors Guild Awards, in addition to receiving her second Academy Award nomination,[41][42][43] as well as Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award nominations.[44][45] In 2012, Time magazine listed Davis as one of the most influential people in the world.[46] Also in 2012, Glamour magazine named Davis Glamour's Film Actress of the year.[47] On June 12, 2012, Davis received the Women in Film's Crystal Award.[48] In 2014, Davis reunited with The Help director Tate Taylor in Get on Up, a biopic of James Brown, playing Brown's mother.[49] Her daughter, Genesis, also appeared in the film.[50] In February 2014, Davis was cast in Peter Nowalk's pilot How to Get Away with Murder (executive produced by Shonda Rhimes for her ShondaLand production company) as the lead character.[51] Her character, Annalise Keating, is a tough criminal defense attorney and professor who becomes entangled in murder plot with her students.[52][53][54] It began as a series in September 2014.[55] In September 2015, Davis became the first African-American to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on How to Get Away with Murder.[56][57] She received a second Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the role in 2016.[58] Davis also won two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2015.[59] She received nominations from the Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series for her performance on the show.[60] In 2015, Davis appeared in Blackhat, a Michael Mann-directed thriller film starring Chris Hemsworth.[61] Davis also served as executive-producer of the crime drama film Lila & Eve, starring herself and Jennifer Lopez in the titular roles.[62] In 2016, Davis starred in the courtroom drama Custody, on which she also served as an executive producer,[63] and played Amanda Waller in the film Suicide Squad, an adaptation of a DC Comics series of the same name.[64] In 2016, Davis reprised her role as Rose Maxson for the film adaptation of Fences directed by and starring Denzel Washington.

But her importance in the culture – her ability to identify it, her willingness to speak about it and take on responsibility for it – is what marks her for greatness."[70] In March 2017, Davis was awarded the Artist of the Year Award at Harvard University.[71] Also in 2017, Davis announced that she would write the sequel to the classic picture book Corduroy, titled Corduroy Takes a Bow. In a press release, Davis stated that "Corduroy has always held a special place in my life, first as a child paging through it, and then again with my daughter, introducing her to the adventures of that adorable teddy bear".[72] The book was published by Penguin Random House later in 2018.[73][74] In 2018, Davis debuted Two-Sides, a documentary series exploring police brutality towards the African-American community.

I was one of those kids, because I grew up in abject poverty; I did everything that you could possibly imagine to get food: I rummaged in the garbage cans, I stole from the local store constantly."[107] As an honoree at the 2014 Variety Power of Women luncheon, Davis further commented that "the thing that made me join...was the word 'eradicate', 'get rid of' – not by thirty-percent not by twenty-percent not by fifty-percent, but to do away [with it]. Because everyone should be a child, and should grow up and have a chance at the American dream".[108] In September 2017, Davis started the $30K in 30 Days Project with Hunger Is, awarding a $1,000 grant to the Rhode Island Community food bank in her home state.[106] As part of her partnership with Vaseline to promote the Vaseline Healing Project, Davis attended the groundbreaking of a free community health center in Central Falls, Rhode Island in October 2016 that was sponsored by the project.[104] The project provides dermatological care to help heal the skin of those affected by poverty around the world.[109][110][111] She was also a speaker at the 2018 Women's March event in Los Angeles.[112] On New Year's Eve 2020, Davis urged Georgia voters who voted via mail or dropbox to track their ballots to ensure their votes count, directing them to VoteRiders for information and help to cure ballots that were not accepted.[113] Personal life Davis married actor Julius Tennon in June 2003.[114] In 2011, the couple adopted an infant daughter named Genesis. Davis is also a stepmother to Tennon's two children from previous relationships.[115] Davis is a Christian and regularly attends services at Oasis Church in Los Angeles.[116][117] Acting credits and accolades Davis is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of her generation.[10][118][119][120][121][122][123][124] Chris Murphy of Vanity Fair said she achieved her reputation and accolades by consistently "delivering deeply felt performances, unmatched in their ability to access a seemingly endless well of emotion while remaining undeniably grounded".[119] Steve McQueen, who directed Davis in Widows, called her "one of the greatest actors of her generation", believing she could act any role if allowed the opportunity.[125] For her stage work, Davis has won two Tony Awards, three Drama Desk Awards, an Obie Award, and a Theater World Award.

Viola Davis (born August 11, 1965, Saint Matthews, South Carolina, U.S.) is an American actress known for her precise, controlled performances and her regal presence. She accomplished the rare feat of winning the four major North American entertainment awards (EGOT: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony). Davis was raised in Central Falls, Rhode Island, where her father found work as a horse groom at nearby racetracks and her mother took on domestic and factory jobs. Their income was frequently insufficient to support the family, and they endured grim rat-infested apartments and occasional food shortages. As a child, Davis began acting in school productions and theatre competitions. She enrolled at Rhode Island College, where she majored in theatre and graduated in 1988. She proceeded to the Young Peoples School for the Performing Arts in Rhode Island on scholarship before attending the Juilliard School, from which she graduated in 1994. In 1996 Davis made her Broadway debut in August Wilson’s Seven Guitars, in which she played the long-suffering paramour of a musician recently released from prison, a performance that earned her a Tony Award nomination. She made her film debut the same year with a bit part in the drama The Substance of Fire. Davis then landed a small role in director Steven Soderbergh’s Out of Sight (1998); he later chose her for bit parts in Traffic (2000) and Solaris (2002). In 1999 Davis played opposite Phylicia Rashad in the Off-Broadway drama Everybody’s Ruby, based on writer Zora Neale Hurston’s investigation of a murder. Davis made a number of television guest appearances before snagging a recurring role as a nurse in producer Steven Bochco’s medical drama City of Angels (2000). The next year she returned to Broadway in another Wilson play, King Hedley II. She won a Tony for her portrayal of a married woman arguing for her right to an abortion. She later played a maid who works for a well-intentioned but cloistered housewife played by Julianne Moore in the Todd Haynes film Far from Heaven (2002) and the mother of the title character in Antwone Fisher (2002), a cinematic adaptation of a troubled African American man’s memoir. In the Off-Broadway play Intimate Apparel (2004), Davis starred as an early 20th-century lingerie designer managing a long-distance love affair. In the film Doubt (2008), Davis played the mother of a young man who may have been molested by a Roman Catholic priest; her brief performance earned her Academy and Golden Globe award nominations for best supporting actress. She demonstrated her comedic skills with an appearance in an installment of Tyler Perry’s Madea franchise, Madea Goes to Jail (2009), and a guest role in 2010 on the Toni Collette TV series United States of Tara. In 2010 she also assumed the female lead in a Broadway revival of Wilson’s Fences opposite Denzel Washington (who had directed her in Antwone Fisher); she won another Tony for her portrayal of the beleaguered Rose. Davis’s performance as a reserved maid at the dawn of the American civil rights era in the film The Help (2011) earned her Oscar and Golden Globe nods for best actress. She then appeared as a kindly stranger who tries to assist a young boy who has lost his father in the 9/11 attacks in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), a screen adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer’s novel. Davis’s later credits include Won’t Back Down (2012), which examined conflicts in American public education; Prisoners (2013), a crime drama about missing children; and Ender’s Game (2013), a science-fiction adventure movie. In 2014 Davis played the mother of soul singer James Brown in the biopic Get On Up and took a supporting role as a college professor in the romantic drama The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby. She then starred as a law professor in the television drama series How to Get Away with Murder (2014–20), and in 2015 she won an Emmy Award for her performance on that show. Davis assumed a supporting role in Michael Mann’s cybercrime thriller Blackhat (2015). She next headed up a team of supervillains as steely government official Amanda Waller in the comic book adaptation Suicide Squad (2016); she reprised the role in The Suicide Squad (2021). Davis reteamed with Washington for the 2016 film adaptation of Fences, which he also directed. For her work in the drama, Davis won a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Consequently, she became the first Black woman to win an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony for acting. Davis then garnered acclaim for her performance in Widows (2018), a heist thriller that transcended the genre to offer a complex narrative about race, class, and gender. She earned further praise—including an Oscar nomination—for her starring turn in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom (2020), an adaptation of Wilson’s play about the legendary blues singer. Davis subsequently appeared in the crime drama The Unforgivable (2021), about a convicted murderer (Sandra Bullock) seeking redemption after being released from prison. In the debut season (2022) of The First Lady, an anthology series about U.S. first ladies, she was cast as Michelle Obama. Her other credits from 2022 include The Woman King, in which she starred as the leader of female warriors in the kingdom of Dahomey; the action drama was based on a true story. In 2023 Davis appeared in Ben Affleck’s Air, a sports drama about how Nike signed Michael Jordan to a historic endorsement deal. Her nuanced portrayal of the basketball legend’s stoic mother earned widespread acclaim. Davis’s memoir, Finding Me, was published in 2022. The following year she won a Grammy for the audio version of the book. With that award, she became the third Black woman to win an EGOT.
