Get the Reddit app A place to find out what's going on in the greater Fresno Metro area. Recommendation on hotels? I'll be visiting in November with my wife and haven't been back to Fresno since I grew up in Visalia in the late 80s. I honestly can't remember what the city was like so I'm hoping some locals can point me in the right direction for nice hotels! (I know I can check Google, but I always like checking in with the community first). We like to drink and go out so anything that has a nice hotel bar or is in a fun area is preferred. Thanks! Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community Top Posts

The Best Hotels in the World: 2024 Readers’ Choice Awards All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase something through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Unforgettable food. Cutting-edge design. Immersive experiences. These are some of your top criteria for judging what makes a quality hotel—not to mention a worthy resort, cruise, spa, or island. In tallying up the 575,048 votes cast in our 37th annual Readers’ Choice Awards survey, we were struck by both your eagerness to embrace the new and your reverence for tried-and-true classics. Your favorite hotel in the five boroughs is the two-year-old Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad, but you also can’t stop returning to storied French Polynesian resort The Brando. You’ve jetted through the sprawling Istanbul International Airport, booked intrepid sailings to Antarctica, and fallen in love with historic yet innovative cities like Copenhagen. Read on to start planning your next round of travels—these are the best hotels in the world, as voted by our readers. View the Readers' Choice Award winners for best resorts in the world here. 50. The Sutton Place Hotel TorontoArrow Sutton Place Hotels’ latest addition gives its guests the best of both worlds—value and luxury, making it a clear winner for travelers seeking to balance the action of downtown Toronto with a quiet place to unwind. Within walking distance of Old Toronto, the Entertainment District, and the Fashion District, guests have access to iconic landmarks such as Eaton Center, the Hockey Hall of Fame, and CN Tower, with Wellington Place’s swankiest restaurants in arm’s reach to boot. After exploring the Six to your heart’s content, coming back to the hotel feels like arriving at your own personal urban oasis. Roomy suites with smart TVs, fast complimentary WiFi, and spa-like bathrooms make it easy to enjoy staying in. The hotel’s gently attentive staff are quick to pop in with recommendations and assist with any changing needs, serving as a shining example of Canadian hospitality we’re won over by. 49. Park Hyatt AucklandArrow The 2021-opened Park Hyatt Auckland looms like a glass palace beside Waitematā Harbor in Wynyard Quarter, the docklands precinct recently converted into the America's Cup home base. The 195 guest rooms are among the most generous in town, with slick interiors by Conran and Partners London punctuated by traditional Maori art. You could say that the new property is now duking it out with the Hotel Britomart (New Zealand’s first five Green Star Hotel) for the braggiing rights to international jet-set crowd. 48. Kimpton Hotel Monaco PittsburghArrow With plush blue velvet couches and tongue-in-cheek artwork sidled up by lime-green tufted headboards and bright-yellow bird cage light fixtures, this quirky 248-room stay could read as a total design disaster—but by some Seussical miracle, it all works. Characteristically thoughtful Kimpton amenities include a minibar stocked with gourmet local treats, Frette linens, and even a yoga mat so you never have to go too long without your beloved sun salutations and downward-facing dogs. Pull up a seat at one of the rooftop Biergarten’s communal tables, where you can nosh on a salted pretzel with one hand and guzzle a heady local brew with the other, or challenge some strangers to a friendly (if slightly unsteady) game of cornhole. If you prefer your vino with a side of quiet, head to the wine hour in the hotel lounge, or opt for 24-hour full-menu room service. The Monaco earns extra points for its pooch-friendly approach, along with its PUBLIC loaner bikes. 47. The Colony Hotel — Palm Beach, FloridaArrow The buzziest place to stay in Palm Beach is the masterfully refreshed, pink paradise that is The Colony Hotel. The playful design harkens back to the Tiki era with wicker furniture, global influences, and hand-painted wallpaper featuring animal scenes and the property's playful mascot Johnnie Brown (a monkey named after the pet of famous architect Addison Mizner) with a martini in hand—it feels like walking into a White Lotus opening theme. Each of the historic property's 89 rooms is custom designed to make the style set of Worth Avenue (which is just paces away) feel at home. But you won't spend too much time in your room, as the on-site restaurant Swifty's is the place to see-and-be-seen enjoying crisp rosé and live music. 46. Four Seasons Hotel MontrealArrow When your cab (or, more likely, chauffeured limo) pulls up to the unmissable black-glass tower that houses the sparkling new Four Seasons Hotel Montreal, a bellhop whisks away your baggage—a metaphor, perhaps, of the emotional journey you’ll take as you breeze past an artsy ground-floor lounge and up an elevator to the third-floor lobby. This hotel is a contender for the most luxurious in town, managing to remain decidedly upscale without becoming ostentatious. Think: your most fabulous friend’s spacious Parisian pied-a-terre (after all, this is a city that prides itself on Francophone connections). The details are gorgeous without being overwhelming or overly precious, with herringbone wood floors, stunning custom furniture pieces, and positively enormous marble bathrooms with heavenly Byredo amenities. It’s worth calling out the truly fantastic, spacious closets; they are beautifully lit, feature well-constructed built-in drawers, and have enough space to hide your luggage away, lending each room and suite a residential feel where you’ll almost forget you’re staying in a hotel. 45. Splendido, A Belmond Hotel, Portofino — ItalyArrow The Splendido Mare, once a fishermen’s guesthouse, is the 14-room harborside sister of Belmond’s Splendido, a hillside hideout that started life as a Benedictine monastery before becoming a hotel in 1901, then a magnet for movie stars (Elizabeth Taylor had four honeymoons there). Its makeover, by in-demand Parisians Charlotte de Tonnac and Hugo Sauzay, is exquisite—local terra-cotta tiles and nautical nods, such as the knots woven into headboards in quietly lavish rooms, with Gio Ponti armchairs and rich Loro Piana fabrics. Everything is done subtly, almost unnoticeably, and there’s a deceptive simplicity to the cooking of brothers Enrico and Roberto Cerea. Their restaurant in Bergamo has three Michelin stars, but here they stick mostly to seafood and Ligurian classics, including a sublime pesto trofie. This is Portofino, after all, which is above all discreet—a place where the actors and the aperitivo-sipping locals don’t much bother one another. 44. Four Seasons Hotel George V — ParisArrow Originally opened in 1928, in a prime location in the ever-so-chic eighth, this hotel is a true Paris icon—but from the moment you enter, it’s clear all is not as traditional as it might seem. The entryway is grand and gilded, the staff deferential and efficient (and always greeting you by name), but flashes of modern style and edgy attitude save the place from seeming staid. This is also the first hotel in Europe to feature five Michelin stars under one roof—garnered here by three distinct restaurants like fine dining Le Cinq, where French classics are reinterpreted using lighter ingredients and techniques. Fortunately, all restaurants are accented by prime vintages from the hotel’s legendary, 50,000 bottle-strong cellar, whose position 45-feet underground helped it survive the bombings of World War II. 43. The Ritz-Carlton Georgetown, Washington D.C.Arrow This redbrick hotel with a smokestack mixes the Potomac’s industrial history with a sleek, modern design and superb location. The impressive conversion effort—it was built on the site of an incinerator—is now a National Historic Landmark, its interior filled with shades of fiery reds, yellows, and oranges. Rooms in earthy hues with dark-leather furnishings offer views of Georgetown and the river; limestone and slate bathrooms have deep soaking tubs. Degrees Bistro pairs contemporary American dishes with brick walls and steel beams; the wine bar sits in the center of the room. 42. Renaissance Chicago Downtown HotelArrow The Loop is Chicago’s fun-loving neighborhood—home to the city’s theater scene, Millennium Park (where you’ll find the mirrored Bean), and the Art Institute of Chicago. At The Renaissance Chicago Downtown, just a block from the Chicago River, the hotel does its best to embody all the high energy the Loop is known for with fascinating art installations in the lobby, a popular rooftop bar called Raised, and even an indoor pool. Yet each of the 553 rooms still give guests the chance to maximize their downtime, thanks to plush bedding, modern bathrooms, and the option to Netflix and chill directly from the hotel television. 41. The Ritz-Carlton, MelbourneArrow When booking a stay down under, why not go to the very top? The Ritz-Carlton, Melbourne is Australia’s tallest hotel, housed in the top 17 floors of its 80-story building. The hotel’s unprecedented vantage point envelops guests in panoramic views of the city and the ocean lapping at Port Phillip Bay. If you find the views hard to pull away from, in-house restaurant Atria helmed by renowned chef Michael Greenlaw serves a seasonal five-course tasting menu for dinner showcasing modern Australian cuisine at its freshest with seats right at the window. And when you settle in for the night, the canvas of the neutrals dotted with warm maroons and deep navies pairs well with golden-framed windows encasing each guest room. With door-to-door valets and a Ritz-Kids program where storytimes bring local Australian culture to life, the standard of service is as sky-high as the rooms. 40. InterContinental Washington D.C. - The Wharf, an IHG HotelArrow Part of D.C.’s reimagined Wharf neighborhood, this new jewel in InterContinental’s crown aims to appeal to leisure travelers and D.C. movers and shakers alike. The dramatic tiered lobby is a mix of stone and brass, with warm chocolate-hued seating and modern chandeliers. Rooms are equally warm, with geometric-patterned carpets, modern dark wood furniture, and expansive windows and balconies, many of which overlook the Potomac River. They're large and spacious, with modern design and amenities (someone thought out the ample counter space in the bathroom, clean lines, and uncluttered layout). Little touches like orchids in each room, spa-style showerheads, and large executive work desks make rooms sumptuous getaways for harried travelers. Whether you're here for business or pleasure, you'll feel the room is well-outfitted for your needs. Enjoy those balconies overlooking the river—it's a real treat and hard to match in this town. 39. The Grand America Hotel — Salt Lake City, UtahArrow From looks alone, you’d be forgiven for assuming the Grand America Hotel was nestled somewhere in the European Alps, as opposed to Salt Lake City’s Wasatch Rockies. Adorned with layered drapery, ornate woodwork, and velvet upholstered desk chairs, the spacious guest rooms feel presidential. The property embraces all the fun of life in Salt Lake City. Snowbirds have their choice of nine ski resorts within an hour’s drive of the hotel, families looking to cool off for the summer can dive into the indoor and outdoor pools, and art buffs can tour through the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art in the day and catch a show from the celebrated Ballet West company at night. But for those looking to stay hyperlocal, the Grand America has menus and venues in-house for every occasion, and the Grand Spa’s full-service specialty treatments are unparalleled in the American West. 38. InterContinental Buckhead Atlanta, an IHG HotelArrow The lobby's marble floors, giant planters, and neutral tones (with the occasional pop of orange) are more or less what you'd expect. Don't forget to stop by the in-house restaurant The Americano, helmed by celebrity chef, Scott Conant. It's those little touches that make the InterContinental more than just a convenient stay. They make it one you'll fall in love with. 37. S Hotel Jamaica — Montego BayArrow At S Hotel you get the laid-back vibe of a stay in Jamaica with a bit of South Beach glitz—they even line the deck of their sleek pool with some of the island’s famous white sand. If that isn’t enough sand for your liking, the hotel also offers private access to idyllic Doctor’s Cave Beach and its gentle surf. Inside, the ocean view rooms are big enough to pass for apartments in some big cities. And they lay a minimalist black and white color scheme over a beachy aesthetic (think, lots of wicker furniture, including covering the bathtub) that will leave you feeling maximally relaxed. If it doesn’t, there’s always the Irie Baths and Spa, which has three underground plunge pools (hot, warm, and cold) that provide kinetic energy therapy and send you out feeling totally relaxed, in addition to the usual the massages and skin treatment options. 36. Waldorf Astoria Beverly HillsArrow Just one deep breath of the lobby's fresh scent and you're in vacation mode. You can find your place in the Waldorf's lobby among couples in artfully ripped jeans and Common Projects sneakers, hot-shot agents, and meticulously maintained ladies in Chanel, or head to your spacious room (the smallest at the hotel is a whopping 630 square feet). But don't get too comfortable down there—the rooftop pool has one of the best views in L.A., complete with an impressive menu from Executive Chef Peleg Miron. 35. Faena Hotel Miami BeachArrow There’s a bit of an Alice in Wonderland vibe to the Faena, and it carries through into the rooms—particularly with the smaller accents and pieces of furniture you’ll find yourself “discovering” as your stay progresses. Los Fuegos, Argentine super-chef Francis Mallmann’s open-fire asado, delivers on the food and drink front; and outside, the hotel makes the most of its 100,000 square feet of private white-sand beach. Also, if you find yourself asking, "Did I just see a golden woolly mammoth skeleton in a glass cage?" the answer is yes—you can thank artist Damien Hirst for that one. 34. Sofitel PhiladelphiaArrow What is this traffic?! More likely than not, this will be your first thought as you approach the 306-room and suite Sofitel, which is located on a perpetually bottlenecked cross street in Center City Philadelphia. But once you’re greeted by the cheery bellmen and step inside the spacious lobby—decked out with a geometric-print stone floor, funky artwork, and comfy lounge seating—all that exterior chaos will fade away. Check-in is quick and efficient, to the delight of the tourists and businesspeople who patronize the hotel, allowing you to get up to that specialty Sofitel bed that much more quickly. Hit Chez Colette for a French-inspired breakfast or weekend brunch, and take advantage of the hotel's prime location—right near Michael Solomonov's Abe Fisher and Dizengoff, and Stephen Starr's The Dandelion and The Love—come dinnertime. 33. Raffles London at The OWOArrow This might be the most talked-about hotel to open in London this century. From 1906 to 1964, the building served as the War Office where D-Day was planned, and where Winston Churchill boomed out briefings to staff on the Grand Staircase while serving as Secretary of State for War. Spies, notoriously, had their own private entrance. In 2016, the Mumbai-based Hinduja Group purchased the building’s lease, invested $1.9 billion in refurbishments, and brought Raffles on board. Completing the 120 rooms and suites, four restaurants, three bars, 27,000-square-foot Guerlain spa, and 65-foot subterranean pool took seven years. Grand state offices have become plum guest quarters, including the Haldane Suite (Churchill’s former office) in smart red damask. Argentine chef Mauro Colagreco helms three of the restaurants: a fine-dining spot, a private-table option, and Saison by Mauro Colagreco, the hotel’s Mediterranean dining space. The Guard’s Bar heaves with gossipy politicians while the tiny Spy Bar, occupying an old interrogation room in the basement, is a good spot for a nightcap with its red-velvet banquettes and an Aston Martin DB5 mounted on the wall. 32. Katikies SantoriniArrow Every hotel in Santorini plays a part when it comes to the island’s picturesque panorama of whitewashed houses and turquoise water, but this brand with outposts in the towns of Imerovigli and Oia alike stands out for its first-class views of the caldera and chic minimal design. In each room, you’ll find arched ceilings and verandas—perfect for lazy afternoons spent reading in the sun—and beds are fitted with crisp, fine cotton sheets. Start the day with a swim in one of the hotel’s infinity pools (or a plunge in your own private one, if you're at the Chromata) before retreating to the bar for a lunchtime cocktail or the spa for pampering. Later, make your way to dinner at the candlelit Chroma or Anthós by walking the winding steps carved into the cliffside. Order dishes like the langoustine tartare or the sea bass served with fennel, and choose from an extensive wine list that spotlights local Santorini wineries. 31. Hyatt Regency MilwaukeeArrow Milwaukee is one of the US’s cities to watch, as we noted in last year’s Readers’ Choice Awards—from having a festival in town nearly every weekend, to hosting the last season of Top Chef, to the scattered nods to Frank Lloyd Wright and Frederick Law Olmstead throughout its different parks and residential areas, it’s safe to say Milwaukee is on the rise. And the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee is one of the best stays to experience what the city has to offer, with the Historic Third Ward, the Public Market, and the Marcus Performing Arts Center all within a two mile radius from the hotel. Bring a furry friend for a stay, work comfortably, and lounge at craft-cocktail bar Julep where the “brew” in Brew City comes to life. 30. Grace Hotel Auberge Resorts Collection — SantoriniArrow Along whitewashed steps zigzagging down the side of the caldera in the village of Imerovigli, this tiny (for now) hotel looks out not only on a serene blue horizon but also, in the near distance, a pinnacle of rock topped by the ruins of an ancient castle. The hotel’s exterior is classic, clinging-to-the-cliffside Aegean, and the rooms minimalist modern, with a touch of art here and there to break up the otherwise all-white decor. The service is as attentive as one would expect with only 20 rooms. 29. Fairmont Washington D.C., GeorgetownArrow If you're one of the lucky few who gets to stay at the Georgetown Fairmont, we'd say you have it made. The hotel unveiled the results of a $27 million renovation in June 2016, offering up a total redo of each of the hotel's 415 guest rooms and suites—they're now sleek and sophisticated, anchored by eggplant-hued couches and tufted, cream-colored headboards, and decked out with custom-commissioned, politically savvy artwork (we love the collage of book plates overlain with silhouettes of the DC skyline and a pillbox hat-topped Jackie O.). And who could forget about that pool? Wind down with a drink in hand at the lobby bar—you can't put a price on the atrium view, though it's currently under construction—or rent a bike from the front desk (complimentary for President's Club members) and cruise along the river to the nearby Kennedy Center and Lincoln Memorial. 28. Babylonstoren — South AfricaArrow What if you could actually visit the Garden of Eden? And what if it was surrounded by vineyards, historic Cape Dutch farm buildings, and a formal French-style potager garden, where you could pick your own strawberries and fragrant herbs? At Babylonstoren, in the Drakenstein Valley, 33 miles northeast of Cape Town, the mythical garden comes to life. Founded in 1690, the 590-acre compound is modeled on the farms that supplied the ships making their way around the Cape of Good Hope en route to India. The cottages and suites are minimalist but stylish. You won’t find a grand lobby or an obsequious concierge here, but the staff, most of whom are wearing T-shirts, aprons, or khakis, combine a genuine eagerness to help with a high level of knowledge about the farm and its long history. Stay long enough and eventually—after a visit to the on-site bakery, the winery, the cheesemaker, the butcher, and the farm-tank-style swimming pool—you may forget that you’re staying at a hotel. 27. Palacio Duhau - Park Hyatt Buenos AiresArrow Before Buenos Aires surrendered to the motor car—and every Argentine male modeled his ego on that of Formula One legend Juan Manuel Fangio—Avenida Alvear was one of the city’s main thoroughfares, with horse-drawn carriages and trams rolling by en route to Palermo’s gardens and shaded parks. Something of this Belle Epoque spirit still endures and nowhere more so than at the Palacio Duhau, completed in 1934 as the city mansion of a landed family. Its grand neoclassical façade is right on the avenue, and the lobby is a stately, serene space where light pours in from the terrace onto the fluted marble columns, intricately carved wooden doors and low-slung white leather sofas. The tiered gardens on the terrace are worthy of a scene in The Great Gatsby. Rooms range from spacious and functional to sumptuous and palatial; the boudoir suite has butler service, an enormous marble bathroom and, perhaps more impressive, two private terraces overlooking the avenue below. The Duhau restaurant and public spaces channel the property’s storied glamour, with local couples having lunch and out-of-towners sipping rum-laced Arnaud’s milk-punch cocktails. The surrounding barrio of Recoleta is known for its old-world architecture, and this hotel, modeled on the Château du Marais near Paris, is the maximum expression of Argentine Francophilia. Its only rival on this stately strip is the Alvear Palace—but where the latter flaunts its ostentation, the Hyatt’s grandest South American hotel rather keeps itself to itself. 26. Fogo Island Inn — Newfoundland, CanadaArrow Looking out at the wind-whipped North Atlantic from Fogo Island, you feel like you’re on the edge of the world: just you, the icebergs, and utter silence. Not surprisingly, getting here takes effort—a flight to Gander (in far north Newfoundland and Labrador), followed by a drive and a ferry ride—but there are few places worthy of this trek. The hotel is a modern spin on the fishing-shacks-on-stilts that dot the island, and everything from the furniture to the quilts was created by members of the local community. The 29 rooms all have floor-to-ceiling ocean views (and their own pair of binoculars). But the best thing about coming so far is how you’re made to feel at home: Guests are paired with “community hosts,” who show you around the island. 25. Dunton Town House — Telluride, ColoradoArrow Dunton Town House's location couldn't be better, on a pretty side street just down from Telluride's main drag, and steps from the gondola. Though the facade looks like a classic painted clapboard B&B, the interior whisks you away to the Tyrol, with authentic Austrian fabrics and hand-carved wooden antiques. Only ten people can stay at a time, so the Town House feels ultra-homey, with a mud room and family-style dining table, plus eclectic original art from the owners' collection. 24. The Sukhothai BangkokArrow The Sukhothai brand takes its name from the historical capital of Thailand (now a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site), which means, “the dawn of happiness” in Sanskrit. And the second you step into the Sukhothai Bangkok, you might just feel transported there. The guest rooms, spa, swimming pool, and other facilities on the property are connected through a web of wandering paths that weave through lush gardens, intricate stonework calling back to ancient Thai sculpture, and lotus ponds jostling with mythically large lily pads. When Sukhothai Bangkok opened in 1991, it set the standard for luxury stays in the city, and today, it continues to uphold that standard with its fusion of old-school class and state-of-the-art amenities. Wood-paneled charcoal guest rooms are accentuated with jewel tone lighting fixtures and traditional centerpieces. The interplay of premium local materials such as marble, bronze, and teakwood extends to the dining areas where regular meals are made even more decadent with the bonus of afternoon teas and Sukhothai’s famous chocolate buffet. 23. Claremont Club & Spa, A Fairmont Hotel — Berkeley, CaliforniaArrow Between the palm tree-lined drive and on-site tennis courts, the temperate NorCal weather and the castle-like Tudor Revival architecture, Claremont Club & Spa is an icon pulled straight from the halcyon days of the Bay Area. The property began as the private estate of the Thornburg family, and throughout the century, its storied rooms have hosted legendary guests like Louis Armstrong and Frank Lloyd Wright. Nowadays, Berkeley academics, Nobel laureates, and families from around the country filter through the lobby of this classic California hotel. Newly renovated guest rooms bring this historic landmark into the modern age. Soft blue and grey palettes make these spacious rooms feel soothing and opulent. There are sleek, modernized bathrooms to match—neutral wallpaper and chandeliers set the mood, while oversized soaking tubs provide a place for R&R. From its perch in the Berkeley Hills—a breezy 30-minute drive away from San Francisco—the Claremont Club & Spa provides a breath of respite from the land of tech giants and scrapping startups. 22. The Weston — VermontArrow The Weston is the latest endeavor of the Sharp family, whose impressive hospitality lineage includes The Carlyle and Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City and the Beverly Wilshire in Los Angeles. Formerly the Inn at Weston, the two-building property with nine uniquely designed rooms underwent a sweeping two-and-a-half-year renovation that left no detail unattended. Visiting the exquisitely restored property feels like being hosted in your well-traveled aunt’s country home. Turns out, there's a good reason for the hotel’s worldly, yet distinctly personal, atmosphere: Much of The Weston’s decor is sourced from the Sharp’s personal art and antique collection. The hotel's small-but-mighty spa offers massages (think: sports, Swedish, and essential oil variations) and facial treatments featuring the Natura Bisse skin care line. The Weston shines during winter, but remains a lovely getaway in nature regardless of the season—with plenty of year-round activities available both on and off site. 21. Il San Pietro di Positano — ItalyArrow A tribute to the vision and folly of its creator, Il San Pietro di Positano burrows into a cliff, with an elevator plunging down to the beach via a shaft hacked out of rock. It’s the ultimate Amalfi Coast cocoon, made all the more attractive by delicious but not overly fancy seasonal food. It’s no mystery why the international glitterati have flocked here since the hotel's opening, in 1970—the village’s steep, narrow stone streets and breathtakingly beautiful blue waters really are the stuff of dreams (ours, anyway). The 56-room property, which sits on a sliver of prime cliff side real estate above the Bay of Positano, is a primitive Eden doused in fragrant flora and citrus trees. Exquisitely tiled rooms with bright linen accents and wide windows have perfect sea views, and quirky features like lamps with fanciful centaur designs and gilded coffee tables add a little bit of luxe. Some even have a private elevator and a Jacuzzi room. Ease into your day with a plate of succulent strawberries and a thimble of espresso, then take an elevator down to a private beach—or enlist a complimentary boat ride around the bay. Dinner at the Michelin-starred Zass is a strawberry crème-colored vision, and twice as delicious—Mediterranean specialties like lobster tagliatelle and truffle sauce-coated sea bass are served on pink tables, on a rock ledge high above the breaking waves. 20. Hotel Jerome, Auberge Resorts Collection — Aspen, ColoradoArrow There’s an inimitable charm to Aspen’s Hotel Jerome. From high to rustic fashion, the 135-year-old historical landmark sits in a perfect location for both rest and play. Offering both complementary hotel-to-hill transportation and walkable proximity to designer shops, a stay at the Jerome is as convenient as it is decadent. There is a strong sense of Aspen’s heart in this gem of a hotel—and it’s celebrated by those locals, travelers, and celebrities who àpres, dine, and book stays here. The staff is friendly and highly intuitive of guests' needs. Concierge remembers your name and itinerary. The waiters recall previous orders and encourage you to taste something new. 19. COMO Castello del Nero — Barberino Tavarnelle, ItalyArrow Not your average Tuscan estate, this 12th-century castle wedged deep into the Chianti countryside 40 minutes south of Florence, is COMO’s first property in mainland Europe. And what a place: This once flouncy Italianate hotel has been transformed into a thoroughly modern, city-sleek pad with brooding gray and putty-colored walls paired with eau-de-nil armchairs and the odd jade patio door. COMO’s highlights are its spas, of course, and this one doesn’t disappoint, with signature COMO Shambhala treatments, Guinot facials, and an outdoor pool in the summer season (when there’s also outdoor yoga, overlooking the rolling hills). At Michelin-starred restaurant La Torre, executive chef Giovanni Luca Di Pirro works his magic on local ingredients; pre-game with an oil or wine tasting in the medieval wine cellars. 18. Hotel Bennett — CharlestonArrow Charleston keeps its buildings low and its historic church steeples high, which meant that owner Michael Bennett had to fight all the way to the State Supreme Court for permission to build his lofty, nine-story hotel. But the view from its rooftop bar and pool is unmatched: On the horizon line, the sky meets a ribbon of shimmering harbor encircling the lower peninsula. Smart guests park themselves up here, settling into cushioned wicker with a craft cocktail to watch snowy egrets migrate in the setting sun. The lower levels of this grand hotel are worth leisurely exploration, from the sprawling second-floor ballroom lounge to Camellias, the stylish, pink Champagne bar tucked off the breezy marble lobby. The sunny corner bakery La Pâtisserie has a pressed-tin ceiling along with fresh pastries, strong coffee, and stacks of newspapers that attract Charlestonians and out-of-towners alike. The hotel spills directly onto Marion Square, a public park known for its weekend farmers market—just one more perk of staying here. 17. JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square SeoulArrow Few skyline views are quite like those at the JW Marriott in Dongdaemun Square. Dongdaemun means the Great East Gate, one of the famed Eight Gates of Seoul, and the Joseon era landmark stands proudly atop the hustle and bustle of modern Seoul. The property itself features glass-encased executive suites, a white marble indoor pool, and five deluxe in-house dining options ranging from Korean barbecue to intricately designed pastries and soju mojitos at the piano lounge. But perhaps the hotel’s greatest asset is its convenient access to Seoul—the Dongdaemun subway station has an entrance internal to the hotel where guests are just five minutes away from downtown proper. 16. Limelight Hotel DenverArrow Denver’s is the first urban outpost of Limelight Hotels, the hospitality group best known among the thrill-seeking crowd for its locations in Aspen and Snowmass, Colorado, and Ketchum, Idaho. The hotel is located just steps off from Union Station, where all the best things to do in Denver are well within reach. After catching a Nuggets game in Ball Arena, or taking in the majesty of Colorado’s natural landscape at a show in Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Limelight offers a plethora of amenities to help you recharge before your next outing. Enjoy arriving back in style and comfort with the hotel’s complimentary Tesla service, book an in-room massage facing floor-to-ceiling views of the Rocky Mountains, or relax on your own with Therabody products and a mug from the Lavazza coffee maker. Midwest coziness radiates in the design of the guestrooms, where wood-paneled bedrooms, leather headboards, plaid throw pillows, and statement pieces made from 32 local artists commissioned by Limelight create the absolute picture of vacationing in Denver. 15. Conrad DubaiArrow This sleek, glassy tower has a grand, burgundy-accented lobby with large pieces of artwork. It might feel a little corporate to some (it is a Hilton, after all), but the location, near the Dubai World Trade Center metro station, can’t be beat. Rooms are decidedly plain with little decor and generic, veneered furniture. Views, however, can be spectacular. There is however, a nightclub on the 48th floor, so if you're sensitive to noise, stay on a lower floor. 14. The Peninsula Hong KongArrow Let’s say you’re arriving by land and not by helicopter (though that’s an option, should you wish). The first thing you'll see is a colonial white facade attended by a fleet of Brewster green Rolls Royce Phantoms and pillbox-topped pageboys. Classical music from a live string quartet wafts throughout the space as you make your way to check-in. This unique blend of old-world Hong Kong, contemporary comforts, and world-class service make The Peninsula Hong Kong a memorable property, whether your mission is business or pleasure. 13. The Godfrey Hotel ChicagoArrow The cubist-inspired building housing The Godfrey stands out in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. That same edgy vibe shows up in the hotel’s starkly marbled lobby and slick rooms with contrasting textiles, like velvety purple couches and leather benches. For a crowd and a scene in summer, look no further than the 10,000-square-foot I|O Godfrey—one of the largest indoor-outdoor rooftop spaces in the city. 12. Le Méridien Essex ChicagoArrow From its airy midcentury modern design to the unbeatable views of Chicago’s skyline and Lake Michigan, Le Méridien Essex Chicago fits all the cosmopolitan chic of the Windy City’s downtown into 14 compact stories. Seated just across from Grant Park, the hotel has prime accessibility to major must-dos in the city, being just a 5-minute walk from Museum Campus and a 15-minute walk from the Art Institute of Chicago. Le Méridien Essex Chicago’s 274 guest rooms are filled with subtly elegant details such as the hidden speakers in the bathroom mirrors and custom Frette bathrobes. The thoughtfulness extends to every nook and cranny of the property— for instance, in the fitness center, guests can spin on Pelotons equipped with Hulu and Netflix. The in-house restaurant, Grant Park Bistro, serves New American classics with European panache—think charred broccolini risotto and Iberico pork skirt steak. 11. La Mamounia — MarrakechArrow There’s a very particular effect exerted by La Mamounia, which seems to take hold the moment you head up the green tiled steps to this most bohemian of grandes dames. Upon seeing La Mamounia’s faded pink walls, Churchill was wont to ditch the suit and pick up his watercolor brushes; Paul McCartney wrote “Mamunia” (meaning “safe haven” in Arabic) during a 1973 stay; and Hitchcock, who filmed The Man Who Knew Too Much here, got his inspiration for The Birds from some overzealous finches on a jardin-facing balcony. La Mamounia was always a curious mash-up of Art Deco, Berber, and opulent Moorish, and the old place has had numerous facelifts over almost 100 years—from Jacques Majorelle’s bright stylings in 1946 to a theatrical noughties revamp by Jacques Garcia (Hotel Costes) and most recently a series of sly additions by Parisian futurists Jouin Manku, including a new cinema and teahouse. There are all the columns, foliage-filled courtyards, and mosaics of the most photogenic medina riad—except that there’s also the smoky Churchill speakeasy, an Asian-focused Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant with its sultry blacks and reds, and that legendary, vast square pool, where the people-watching irresistible (bring dark sunglasses). There’s a reason that the actors and rock stars have kept coming; the fashionistas with kaftans and cigarettes. For all that it is woven into Marrakech like the knots in a Berber rug, La Mamounia has never, ever been boring. 10. Hotel Zena Washington D.C.Arrow Girls trips take on a new meaning at D.C.'s “future is female”–themed hotel, complete with with funky, feminist art and a souvenir shop that funds nonprofits around the world. The unique theme of Hotel Zena is spelled out in seven stories on the building's exterior: a larger-than-life mural of two women warriors stretches across Hotel Zena, painted by an artist known as Miss Chelove. Inside, the lobby and lower-level Figleaf restaurant is decorated with more art inspired by women's empowerment. The most talked-about piece must be Andrea Sheehan x Julie Coyle Art Associates's portrait of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg constructed out of 20,000 painted tampons. Aside from the soft glow of pink lighting above the headboard, the 191 rooms are decorated in creamy tones and furniture with clean lines. Translucent, pod-like showers are decorated with murals of the Greek goddess Artemis. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide plenty of natural light, and it's worth it to spring for a Circle View room to looking out onto landscaped Thomas Circle and the city skyline. 9. The Hazelton Hotel TorontoArrow For discreet luxury that makes you feel like a member of a private club, few spots top The Hazelton. The leafy, boutique-lined streets of the upscale Yorkville neighborhood provide the natural backdrop for this plush boutique hotel, which is marked by a brick-and-white façade and rounded entrance. Stroll by the see-and-be-seen outdoor patio (a local favorite) and make your way inside, where you’ll find a contemporary lobby bedecked in polished metals, ostrich leather, and amber lighting. And thanks to their ample square footage (575 square feet and up) and nine-foot ceilings, the 62 rooms and 15 suites feel like apartments. 8. Gravity Haus Breckenridge — ColoradoArrow Powder hounds got a new reason to cheer when Gravity Haus, a 60-room ski-in/ski-out boutique hotel, opened in 2019 at the base of Breckenridge Ski Resort’s Peak 9. The lobby has an Alpine-sleek aesthetic: hardwood herringbone floors, a roaring fire in a clean-lined hearth, lofted ceilings with pendant lights, and wood-paneled walls. Guest rooms have a modern lodge appeal, wood and plaid throws, a simple desk for the unavoidable work check-in, and an emphasis on eco-awareness, like WinkBed mattresses and natural bath products from EO Essential Oils. The hotel is part lodging, part social club, and 100 percent focused on catering to a certain type of hard-charging, outdoor enthusiast. There’s a fitness and sport-recovery center and lanes for duckpin bowling, plus a co-working space, coffee shop and restaurant, and even a Japanese-inspired onsen. 7. Colony Palms Hotel — Palm Springs, CaliforniaArrow This luxuriously private adults-only hotel from celebrated celebrity designer Steve Hermann is in the heart of Palm Springs but has a more laid-back, exclusive vibe than its neighbors—like The Beverly Hills Hotel meets the desert. Firepits and private nooks are sprinkled throughout the property, centered on a verdant, palm-tree-lined pool shimmering below the San Jacinto Mountains. Bold statement wallpapering, sky-high ceilings, and plenty of greenery are the through lines across the room categories, with suites offering private verandas with garden seating. Chef Michael Hung has upped the ante for poolside dining at The Colony Club, where you’ll find excellent spins on California Mediterranean cooking. 6. Viceroy Washington D.C.Arrow There's no shortage of D.C. properties, but Viceroy in the city's downtown earns bragging rights as our favorite. The vibe is decidedly distinguished, like the digs of a funky but well-polished beau: Walk in to the lobby, and you’re hit with a full-frontal bookshelf, set against an inlaid wood wall and accompanied by soft, sturdy woolen armchairs, perfect for reading the Sunday paper. With a sleek residential feel (it was formerly an apartment building),the 178 guest rooms are larger than many other options in town. Popular dining and drinking spots on-wite round out the offerings—and explain why you're just as likely to rub elbows with a local as an out-of-towner when you sit down for a drink or a bite. 5. The Ritz-Carlton, KyotoArrow If room views made up their own category, this Ritz-Carlton, set along the shores of the Kamogawa River, would be in a class all its own. Beside its prime real estate by the water, the hotel also offers views of the nearby Higashiyama mountains (you can also opt for views of a traditional Japanese Zen garden, or the city of Kyoto itself). Rooms have impeccable detail, like shippo (a type of cloisonné, or painted metalwork that the city is proudly known for); try the Garden suite, where you can sit on the balcony after a soothing bath with Shabonya handmade soap, and kick back in your Imabari bathrobe and slippers. 4. The Thief — OsloArrow Remember when some places used to call themselves art hotels, for the sake of a few second-rate daubings on the walls? Well, this opened in 2013, a key player in Oslo’s waterside reboot, and has the sort of collection many urban galleries would kill for. There’s a genuflecting bronze by Antony Gormley outside by the revolving doors, a Julian Opie animation in the lift, and you’ll spot pieces by Warhol, Richard Prince, Niki de Saint Phalle, and Tony Cragg dotted around the public spaces. The Thief is the work of Petter Stordalen, who drives a biofuel-powered Ferrari and has banned bacon in his hotels for sustainability reasons, and straddles the water on the reclaimed islet of Tjuvholmen, a sheeny-shiny place of glinting bridges and new builds, many of which are home to small independent galleries. The spa and pool are accessed via a secret underground tunnel—locals come for the Sauna Guss experience—and rooms are clad in touchy-feely textures, golds, and grays, with picture windows to slide wide open for gulps of Nordic sea air from the harbor below. The rooftop FoodBar restaurant, led by British chef David Taylor, has fun with regional ingredients (scallops, turnips, monkfish, lamb neck), and the bar has helped up Oslo’s cocktail game (try the Michael Jackson and Bubbles—rum, banana cordial, green tea, Champagne, in a ceramic monkey head). Oslo’s overflowing oil wealth meant this was a city that never bothered itself unduly with drawing visitors, but that’s changed and it now rocks a go-getting international outlook—this is the best place to feel you’re part of that. 3. Hermann Bungalows — Palm Springs, CaliforniaArrow This is the place for ultimate Palm Springs mid-century luxury, designed with the most sumptuous details and suited for the natural landscape—including prime poolside San Jacinto Mountain views. It's also an uncommon experience: a resort within a resort. One is luxury while the other is “ultra-luxury.” The latter is Hermann Bungalows, a uniquely chic 24-suite lodge opened by designer-hotelier Steve Hermann in 2022. It’s adjacent to L’Horizon Resort & Spa (25 rooms), which Hermann opened in 2015 after a $10 million renovation of an existing mid-century property. Bungalow guests enter through L’Horizon’s lobby to reach their own fully contained hotel, whose design inspiration is rooted in the mid-century-modernism architecture of Richard Nuetra. Guests can stay in the privacy of the Hermann Bungalows, or access all of the amenities of L’Horizon Resort, including its pool, the Spa, and the elegant SO.PA restaurant. 2. The Ritz-Carlton, DohaArrow Qatar might not immediately scream beach destination, but Ritz-Carlton has dreamed up a relaxing oasis in this on-the-rise Persian Gulf capital. There’s a lovely stretch of sand and a palm-lined freeform pool outside, but when it gets too scorching, come in for the sea-view gym with indoor tennis and squash courts and a spa with a luxury hammam where you can feel reborn after an Arabic clay and kese exfoliation. Of course, befitting the region, there’s also quite a bit of luxury on display: To wit, the property is home to the Middle East’s largest chandelier, a Viennese Baakowitz stunner with 2,000 individual crystals—one of a whopping 264 chandeliers across the property. 1. The Lodge at Bodega Bay — CaliforniaArrow Snuggled into a bluff in the vineyard-peppered Sonoma coast, the Lodge at Bodega Bay is a laid-back getaway. In the mornings, in-house restaurant Drakes Sonoma Coast serves their own spin on the classics from french toast topped with fresh, seasonal compote, to the lodge’s own signature breakfast sandwich packed with all the fixings. During the day, the secluded beaches are free to roam, and local wine tastings are plenty. As the sun begins to set, there’s no better way to wrap the day than retiring in the fireside lounge surrounded by views of the Pacific Ocean. Guest rooms and suites themed with creams and nautical blues punctuated with dark wood accents feel as though they really are a home away from home, from Ocean Shell Massages at the spa to the in-room jacuzzi accommodations to the small details snuck into every corner of the lodge like the binoculars placed on every room’s windowsill that bring the breathtaking balcony views into high-definition.

These 100 Hotels Were Voted Best in the World by T+L Readers — and 16 of Them Are in the U.S. Hotels in Asia, India, and the United States got the most attention from T+L readers in the annual “World’s Best Awards” survey for 2024. Paul Brady is the news director at Travel + Leisure and the brand's expert on cruise travel. He has been covering the travel industry for more than 15 years for outlets including Condé Nast Traveler, Skift, and The Huffington Post. Travel + Leisure readers are going global. In this year’s World’s Best Awards, readers’ favorite hotels span far and wide, with 38 countries making an appearance on the 2024 list. Properties in destinations like India and Southeast Asia are among the highest scorers this year, along with 16 stellar U.S. properties. At each hotel, voters were wowed by the style and the service of the top 100: Every winner scored higher than 97 on our 100-point survey. Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts How Voting Works Every year for our World's Best Awards survey, T+L asks readers to weigh in on travel experiences around the globe — to share their opinions on the top hotels, resorts, cities, islands, cruise ships, spas, airlines, and more. Over 186,000 T+L readers completed the 2024 survey. A total of more than 700,000 votes were cast across over 8,700 properties (hotels, cities, cruise lines, etc.). Hotels were classified as either resort hotel, city hotel, inn, or safari lodge based on their location and amenities, and they were specifically rated on the criteria below: For each characteristic, respondents could choose a rating of excellent, above average, average, below average, or poor. The final scores are averages of these responses. What Readers Loved T+L readers traveled off the beaten path this past year. Each of the top 10 properties is located in a different country, from Spain to Qatar to Mexico. In Europe, England had four properties in the top 100, while France, Italy, and Spain each had two. Thirteen safari lodges and resorts caught our readers’ attention in Kenya, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The highlights of some of these stays? Readers mentioned chimpanzee tracking, private game drives, and accommodations so close to the action, they could hear the animals. Those craving a calmer getaway found what they were looking for in villas next to white-sand beaches and crystal blue seas. The Maldives and the Indonesian island of Bali were particularly popular, with four and six hotels, respectively, in the top 100. While each winning property has its own allure — from an underwater restaurant at one property to pro surfers-turned-coaches at another — all these escapes offered voters the satisfaction of pure isolation without skimping on service. For all the international adventure, T+L readers spent time exploring the United States, too, which has 16 properties on this year’s list. California has the most properties in the U.S. in the top 100, with four seaside hotels in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Newport Beach, Oceanside, and Sausalito. And the East Coast received some love, in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, and South Carolina. Below, find a full rundown of the top 100 hotels in the world, as voted by T+L readers. The Full List 1. The Oberoi Rajvilas, Jaipur: Jaipur, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts Maybe it’s the peacocks that roam the grounds, or maybe it’s the sumptuous rooms — many with private gardens and plunge pools — that put this luxurious retreat over the top. Readers simply can’t get enough of this world-class hotel in one of India’s most alluring cities. “Truly magical — a beautiful property and a very serene oasis,” said one voter. “An amazing experience,” agreed another. The impeccably manicured gardens play host to morning yoga classes, while there’s a full lineup of treatments at the guests-only spa. The most enticing element of a stay, though, may be the sense of calm with which the staff of the Oberoi Rajvilas carry themselves — and pass on to their appreciative guests. Reader Score: 99.79 2. La Casa de la Playa: Playa del Carmen, Mexico Courtesy of La Casa de la Playa A close second in reader voting, this Playa del Carmen hideaway is a 63-room boutique hotel that feels super-exclusive while also offering access to all the amenities of the Grupo Xcaret development. Experiences on- and off-property are all handled by the in-house team; a Virgilio Martinéz restaurant is a particular dining highlight. Reader Score: 99.76 3. The Ritz-Carlton, Doha: Doha, Qatar Courtesy of The RItz-Carlton, Doha Hidden away on a small, exclusive island near the city’s Pearl Island development, this family-friendly five-star has what one voter calls “some of the best service and facilities in Qatar,” including several restaurants, pools, views of Persian Gulf, and a private beach. The fitness facilities — including racquet-sports courts — wowed voters, too. Reader Score: 99.64 4. Park Hyatt Siem Reap: Siem Reap, Cambodia Courtesy of Park Hyatt Siem Reap A legendary luxury property designed by the prolific Bill Bensley, the Park Hyatt is a richly appointed option on the way to Angkor Wat. “Lovely and authentic hospitality, consistent service, and friendly staff, with excellent food,” said one reader, who also appreciated the property’s two swimming pools. Reader Score: 99.40 5. Selman Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of Selman Marrakech A Marrakesh classic, the Selman is famous for its collection of Arabian horses, which occasionally parade around the gardens to the delight of guests. But the Jacques Garcia–designed resort is anything but a one-trick pony: its 60 rooms, suites, and villas are some of the city’s most glamorous, and a Chenot spa has almost every biohacking treatment imaginable. Reader Score: 99.39 6. Gran Hotel Mas d'en Bruno: Torroja del Priorat, Spain Courtesy of Gran Hotel Mas d'en Bruno Opened in 2023 in the burgeoning Spanish wine region of Priorat, this new Relais & Châteaux retreat with just 24 rooms has major culinary ambitions at its main restaurant, Vinum. “They are making amazing meals, with the best products the region has to offer, without being pretentious,” said one voter, who also raved about the “beautiful views and utter peace and quiet” at the hotel. Reader Score: 99.33 7. Regent Hong Kong: Hong Kong, China Courtrsy of Regent Hong Kong A new global flagship for the refreshed Regent brand, this 497-room Hong Kong hotel was years in the making. The wait, voters said, was worth it for this luxurious perch along the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade. The seven on-site restaurants, including the two Michelin star Lai Ching Heen, also impressed readers. Reader Score: 99.33 8. Pendry Newport Beach: Newport Beach, California Courtesy of Pendry Newport Beach Opened last fall with a celebrity-filled party, this property marks the third in Southern California for Pendry, a brand that prides itself on exceptional service in boutique spaces. The 20-story hotel has injected new life into the Newport Beach social scene with a private members' club, a swanky lounge with live music, and several luxe dining options. Reader Score: 99.29 9. (tie) Alma Resort: Cam Ranh, Vietnam Courtesy of Alma Resort Oceanfront Alma, on the Cam Ranh Peninsula just south of Nha Trang, Vietnam, is a full-featured beach resort with 12 pools, 14 restaurants and bars, plenty of kid-friendly activities, a spacious spa — and even an on-property farm from which many ingredients are sourced. Reader Score: 99.20 9. (tie) Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi: South Malé Atoll, Maldives Athul Prasad The top-scoring Maldives property on this year’s list, the Waldorf Astoria is a study in maximalist luxury. “It was an unforgettable experience,” said one respondent, summing up the vibe among voters. While the main resort has plenty to offer, the most eye-catching feature of the Waldorf Astoria may be its private island, an exclusive escape with room for up to 24 guests — and a nightly price tag approaching six figures. Reader Score: 99.20 11. Mission Pacific Beach Resort: Oceanside, California Courtesy of Mission Pacific Beach Resort Winning in three separate categories this year, including No. 1 for best California resort and continental U.S. resort, respectively, this beachside property is more than just California cool. It features private balconies with beach views, a Michelin-starred restaurant, and the original bungalow featured in Top Gun. Reader Score: 99.17 12. Argos in Cappadocia: Turkey, Cappadocia Courtesy of Argos in Cappadocia While new to the World’s Best Awards, this site is anything but, as it’s located in one of the oldest and largest monasteries in the world, built from traditional Turkish stones, wood, and handicrafts. Taste “food beyond imagination,” according to one reader, at on-site Nahita (or sip from one of the cellar’s 70,000 bottles), get a massage overlooking Mount Erciyes and Pigeon Valley, or explore centuries-old underground tunnels beneath the hotel, too. Reader Score: 99.09 12. Capella Ubud: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of Capella Ubud, Bali It’s been described as “a tropical fever dream of tented suites,” a place that was, in 2020, named the best hotel in the world by T+L readers. These days, it remains a highly regarded resort, thanks to its secluded setting in the upland forests near the town of Ubud and enchanting, antiques-filled spaces that feel like nothing else in the world. Reader Score: 99.09 14. Raffles The Palm Dubai: Dubai, United Arab Emirates Courtesy of Raffles The Palm Dubai In signature Raffles fashion, this property from the luxe hotel brand — its first in the Middle East — brings extravagant amenities and glamor to already-bustling Dubai. Take its 6,000 Swarovski Crystal chandeliers or the 80-seat private movie theater on property. And the brand’s acclaimed 24-hour personalized butler service is a highlight for guests, too. Reader Score: 99.08 15. Six Senses Fort Barwara: Rajasthan, India Aparna Jayakumar “A dazzling concoction of new and old,” this stunning palace hotel, which appeared on the May 2022 cover of T+L, occupies some buildings that date back 700 years, not far from India’s Ranthambore National Park. Now part of wellness-oriented Six Senses, the 48-suite resort has a 30,000-square-foot spa and an Ayurvedic practitioner on call. Reader Score: 99.06 16. The Winnetu Oceanside Resort: Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts Courtesy of The Winnetu Oceanside Resort This family-owned property on Martha’s Vineyard gets attention for its “great location” — spanning 11 acres of private beach — outstanding family programming, and menu options at The Dunes restaurant, according to our readers. So it’s no wonder that it took the No. 1 spot on our Best New England Resorts list this year. Reader Score: 99.00 17. Anantara Kihavah Maldives Resort: Baa Atoll, Maldives Courtesy of Minor Hotels A collection of 80 villas and multi-bedroom “residences,” the only Anantara resort to make this list distinguishes itself with an impressive array of activities and amenities, including an underwater restaurant, a celestial observatory, and a kids’ club. Reader Score: 98.95 18. La Mamounia Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of La Mamounia Marrakech The legendary hotel recently celebrated 100 years, and its next century is looking bright, thanks to a recent refurb that spruced up public spaces while adding a 20-seat cinema, a semi-secret wine bar, and a South Asian restaurant from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Reader Score: 98.94 19. Tierra Atacama: San Pedro de Atacama, Chile Courtesy of Tierra Atacama One of the three lodges operated by Chile-based Tierra Hotels, this intimate all-inclusive in the heart of the country’s northern desert is a go-to for stargazers, bird watchers, and adventurers. While this hotel is currently under renovation as of April 1, 2024, you can make a reservation now for March 2025 and beyond. Reader Score: 98.93 20. The Mulia: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The Mulia This beachfront, idyllic escape in the Nusa Dua resort area is a perfect combination “ of luxury and relaxation,” according to one reader. From private butler services to suites with Jacuzzi-equipped balconies, the Mulia ensures first-class service worth talking about when you return home. Reader Score: 98.92 21. Monwana Game Lodge: Thornybush Nature Reserve, South Africa Courtesy of MORE Family Collection Home to the Big Five in Greater Kruger National Park, this property is described by one reader as “an oasis in the bush.” From the intimate, six spacious suites to private butler service and a dedicated game-viewing team, it’s no wonder Monwana also took home the No. 1 spot for our readers’ favorite Africa safari lodges. Reader Score: 98.90 22. Joali Maldives: Raa Atoll, Maldives Courtesy of JOALI A soulful resort with a particular focus on the arts, this 73-villa resort has site-specific works, interactive exhibits, studio classes, and a gorgeous boutique — as well as all the traditional luxury trappings, including on-the-water activities, several dining options, and a high-end spa. Reader Score: 98.88 23. Nihi Sumba: Sumba, Indonesia Georg Schorschal/Courtesy of NIHI Sumba Located in Eastern Indonesia, this legendary resort retains many of the same draws that made it a must-visit when it first opened, as Nihiwatu, in 2001: surf, sand, splendid isolation. In 2016 and 2017, readers ranked it the No. 1 hotel in the world. Today, it remains a 27-villa paragon of barefoot luxury — and of philanthropy, by way of the Sumba Foundation, which supports the surrounding community. Reader Score: 98.85 24. Hotel Hartness: Greenville, South Carolina Courtesy of Hotel Hartness Just about a year after opening its doors, this 73-suite, family-owned hotel in Greenville is now the No. 1 best resort in South Carolina. Inspired by the design of the Hartness family’s own home, the property is modern yet welcoming, featuring a full-service spa and two dining options. Reader Score: 98.80 24. Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Goa: Goa, India Courtesy of Taj Exotica Resort & Spa, Goa Concealed in the greenery on the edge of Radhanagar Beach, this 46-acre property in India’s remote Andaman Islands doesn’t need to advertise its seclusion. The raised villas — an homage to the traditional homes of local Indigenous communities — and three dining options supplied by the on-site organic garden are just two reasons why this Taj dream made the 2024 list. Reader Score: 98.80 26. The Peninsula Istanbul: Istanbul, Turkey Emre Dorter/Courtesy of The Peninsula Hotels The new Peninsula hotel, which opened in February 2023, occupies a series of historic — and now beautifully refurbished — buildings along the Bosphorus. “The crisp service, the walkable location, and the top-tier amenities give it an edge,” wrote editor-in-chief Jacqui Gifford in her recent rave review, a sentiment shared by WBA voters. Reader Score: 98.77 27. (tie) The Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra: Agra, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts One of the most enchanting resorts in India, the Amarvilas overlooks the Taj Mahal, a short walk away. Views of the famed mausoleum aside, the property also impresses with its manicured gardens, lovely swimming pool, and fantastic cuisine — not to mention a peaceful terrace that’s the perfect spot for a sundowner. Reader Score: 98.74 27. (tie) The St. Regis Bali Resort: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The St. Regis Bali Resort On the shores of Nusa Dua Beach is an escape in the jungle. Guests can stay in a garden-view suite, with the sound of waves streaming through the windows, or one of the 41 villas featuring private pools and outdoor lounge areas. Either way, a stay here is “exquisite,” says one reader, no doubt in part thanks to The St. Regis’ famed 24-hour butler service. Reader Score: 98.74 29. Asilia Namiri Plains: Serengeti National Park, Tanzania Courtesy of Asilia Namiri Plains “This is big cat country,” is how Asilia, the luxury safari operator, describes the location of its remote, 11-tent escape that’s a haven for those in search of cheetahs, leopards, lions, and servals. A pair of larger “retreats,” with two bedrooms and private staff, are perfect for families or groups of friends. Reader Score: 98.73 30. Candleberry Inn: Brewster, Massachusetts Courtesy of Candleberry Inn “It’s like a big warm hug,” said one reader of the newly named No. 1 property on T+L’s Best Continental U.S. Inn list. Priding itself on “simple elegance,” the Candleberry Inn offers a comfortable stay in a historic home in the heart of Cape Cod — a quintessential New England experience. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Finch Hattons: Tsavo West National Park, Kenya Courtesy of Finch Hattons A classic safari lodge in one of Kenya’s most noteworthy wildlife areas, Finch Hattons has been impressing guests for more than 30 years, thanks to top-notch guides, excellent game spotting, and plenty of family-friendly amenities, including a Masai Warrior Training program for children. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Rosewood Phnom Penh: Phnom Penh, Cambodia Courtesy of Rosewood Phnom Penh Hotels with views aren’t a new feat, but this hotel soaring more than 615 feet above Cambodia’s largest city, spread across the top 14 floors, is truly one of a kind. Readers praised this property for its location, the “excellent service,” and the food — serving traditional Cambodian cuisine, as well as French, Japanese, and Chinese too, across six venues. Reader Score: 98.67 30.

The Oberoi Udaivilas, Udaipur: Udaipur, India Aparna Jayakumar Three properties in the lakeside city of Udaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, made the top 100 this year, proof that this evocative destination remains top of mind for T+L readers. The Oberoi charmed voters with its opulent design, orchestrated by Bill Bensley to mimic the palatial architecture seen around Lake Pichola, as well as its top-notch dining and can-do staff. Reader Score: 98.67 30. Tokoriki Island Resort: Tokoriki Island, Fiji Courtesy of Tokoriki Island Resort This first-time winner is so loved, it had two readers crying when they left the property.

Reader Score: 98.67 36. The Leela Palace Bengaluru: Bangalore, India Courtesy of Leela Palace Bengaluru One of three Leela Palace properties in the top 100, and the one with the highest score, this grand dame in the middle of India’s Silicon Valley stands out for its dining options, “impeccable” service, and most of all, its design. The nine acres of manicured grounds and pink sandstone facade had one reader “captivated by the grandeur and elegance of the architecture, which truly made me feel like royalty.” Reader Score: 98.59 37. Villa Mara: Carmel-By-The-Sea, California Courtesy of Villa Mara Just two years old, this chic, 16-room luxury boutique is new to the annual World’s Best List, and it has readers talking.

Reader Score: 98.53 39. The Oberoi Vanyavilas Wildlife Resort, Ranthambhore: Ranthambhore, India Courtesy of Oberoi Hotels & Resorts In true Oberoi fashion, this property challenges the boundaries of normalcy. Beside the jungle — or in this case, Ranthambhore National Park — sip on cocktails by bonfire in the courtyard, sleep amid the stars in opulent tented accommodations, and then hop on for a custom jungle ride to see protected tigers. What’s not to like? Reader Score: 98.53 40. Flemings Mayfair: London, England Courtesy of Flemings Mayfair Described by one reader as a “true gem in the heart of London,” one of the oldest hotels in the city isn’t afraid of change.

Plus, the on-site menu is consistently adapted to pair well with current Santa Rita vintages, giving guests first access to ingredients harvested on the very grounds you’re inhabiting. Reader Score: 98.50 40. Hyatt Regency Koh Samui: Koh Samui, Thailand Courtesy of Hyatt Regency Koh Samui New to the World’s Best Awards, and the only Hyatt Regency property making the top 100, this oceanfront property prides itself on establishing a “gallery-inspired setting.” Adding to its allure is the Veriō Spa, which renders services like the five-day Energy Boost Wellness Journey, with bath rituals, personalized meals, and daily massages. Reader Score: 98.50 40. Regent Beijing: Beijing, China Courtesy of Regent Beijing This 496-room hotel is the only establishment in mainland China to appear on the 100 Best Hotels list. Helping it achieve the high marks are a prime location near the Forbidden City, a wide variety of superlative restaurants, and on-point service. Reader Score: 98.50 44. Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok: Bangkok, Thailand Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok A long-time reader favorite, this heritage property traces its history back nearly 150 years — but offers the contemporary amenities today’s travelers demand, including a dozen restaurants and bars, a terrific spa, and thoughtfully curated excursions (a bike tour in the nearby neighborhood) and activities (fitness classes with a muay Thai expert). Reader Score: 98.48 45. Kalesma Mykonos: Mykonos, Greece Courtesy of Kalesma Mykonos Maybe it's the private infinity-edge pools, or the sweeping views of Ornos Bay that make this three-year-old, family-owned property in Mykonos a new reader favorite — either way, with its elegant, totally Greek design and delicious on-site eateries, Kalesma is a tranquil oasis. Reader Score: 98.47 46. Hotel Indigo Bali Seminyak Beach: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of Hotel Indigo Bali Seminyak Beach In the heart of the bustling Seminyak beach development, this IHG resort manages to retain a bit of Bali bliss, thanks to its leafy gardens, a series of swimming pools, and a multi-level spa.

Raffles London at The OWO: London, England John Athimaritis/Courtesy of Raffles London at the OWO An incredible feat of historic preservation, the newest Raffles occupies London’s Old War Office, a stone’s throw from Trafalgar Square and a one-time HQ for Winston Churchill. A nearly $2 billion overhaul has transformed the iconic building into an over-the-top, 120-room urban resort, complete with subterranean Guerlain spa, 65-foot swimming pool, and nine different restaurants and bars — including one, Mauro Colagreco at Raffles London at The OWO, under the auspices of the Argentine chef whose restaurant Mirazur, in the south of France, has three Michelin stars. Reader Score: 98.40 48. Capella Bangkok: Bangkok, Thailand Courtesy of Capella Bangkok One of two Capella hotels on this year’s list, the ultra-chic Bangkok location wowed voters with its riverfront location and its 101 suites and villas.

Reader Score: 98.29 54. Mfuwe Lodge, The Bushcamp Company: South Luangwa National Park, Zambia Courtesy of The Bushcamp Company Not far from the Luangwa River, this might be the most famous lodge in Zambia, thanks to a resident herd of elephants that parade through the lobby from time to time. The 18 guest chalets overlook watering holes, which makes for excellent game viewing right at the lodge. Bushcamp also coordinates guided drives into the nearby national park, as well as walking safaris. Reader Score: 98.26 55. Royal Mansour Marrakech: Marrakesh, Morocco Courtesy of Royal Mansour, Marrakesh One of the world’s most decadent hotels, the palatial Royal Mansour swaps standard rooms and suites for the over-the-top privacy of 53 private villas, each of which follow the architectural style of a Moroccan riad, or courtyard home. The expansive pool deck as well as one of the country’s most cosseting spas, complete with hammam, helps round out the pampering on offer. Reader Score: 98.25 56. The Egerton House Hotel: London, England Courtesy of The Egerton House This Victorian townhouse-turned hotel provides exceptional service in a cozy yet exclusive setting.

The Laguna, a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Nusa Dua, Bali: Bali, Indonesia Courtesy of The Laguna, a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Nusa Dua, Bali Exclusivity is the name of the game in the luxe Nusa Dua resort region of Bali, and this Marriott property knows it. A sprawling renovation unveiled in June 2023 — fit with seven lagoon-shaped swimming pools, 287 rooms inspired by Balinese tradition, and nightly performances at the De Balé Lounge & Bar — landed it a spot on two World’s Best Awards lists for the very first time. Reader Score: 98.22 60.

Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River: Bangkok, Thailand Courtesy of Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok at Chao Phraya River One of three Bangkok accommodations on the 2024 list, this riverside resort, which was designed by Jean-Michel Gathy, seems to have something for everyone, winning votes for its contemporary-chic rooms, leafy gardens, excellent selection of restaurants, and a stunning, 115-foot lap pool. Reader Score: 98.15 65. The Leela Palace Udaipur: Udaipur, India Courtesy of Leela Palace Udaipur This lakefront Leela is a magical experience that starts with an arrival by boat and a shower of rose petals. The palatial decor feels of a place, including the black-and-white, checkerboard tiling that tessellates throughout the property, which also has a lovely spa with water views. Reader Score: 98.13 66. Deer Path Inn: Lake Forest, Illinois Courtesy of Deer Path Inn At this 95-year-old, Tudor-style building on Chicago’s North Shore, charming English hospitality shines through.

Tensing Pen: Negril, Jamaica Courtesy of Tensing Pen Built around its own private coves and views of the Caribbean Sea, Tensing Pen keeps people coming back. One T+L reader has been returning regularly for more than 40 years, noting that her “children learned to swim off the spectacular platformed cliffs.” For another, it’s the “great food in the Lodge Restaurant” that has inspired three visits. Even a first-time visitor’s sentiment can sum up the experience: “I would recommend 100% to anyone who wants to feel like they're in paradise and be treated like royalty.” Reader Score: 98.07 68. Nayara Springs: Arenal Volcano National Park, Costa Rica Courtesy of Nayara Springs An adults-only enclave in the heart of the rainforest, this sustainability-minded Relais & Châteaux retreat has just 35 villa accommodations.

Reader Score: 98.06 69. (tie) Kyambura Gorge Lodge: Greater Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda Courtesy of Volcanoes Safaris “I dream of another day sipping cocktails post chimp trek,” said one voter about this lodge set 15 miles from the Equator, overlooking the Kyambura Gorge. The recently renovated thatched-roof bandas, similar to bungalows, caught the attention of voters, as well as the excursions — from chimpanzee tracking to game drives to see tree-climbing lions — that are only possible due to the convenient access to the adjacent Queen Elizabeth National Park. Reader Score: 98.00 69. (tie) Signiel Seoul: Seoul, South Korea Courtesy of SIGNIEL Seoul For striking views, it’s hard to beat this 235-room hotel housed within the 87th to 101st floors of the Lotte World Tower, South Korea’s tallest building, in the Gangnam district. You can catch the view from the spa’s sauna, and then retreat to enjoy sips in the lounge, get an aromatherapy body massage, or venture to the Stay — the French dining option where one T+L contributor claims she had the best eggs she’s ever eaten. Reader Score: 98.00 71. Las Ventanas al Paraíso, a Rosewood Resort: San José del Cabo, Mexico Courtesy of Las Ventanas al Paraiso, a Rosewood Resort “It’s like they know what I want before I ever ask,” is how one reader describes the service at this Rosewood property, which represents two Mexico hotels on the top 100. Another reason this 27-year-old property continues to draw attention? Mexican craftsmanship is on full display at Las Ventanas, from the in-room, woven bed runners to outdoor sculptures, and even on-site workshops like hat embroidery, too. Reader Score: 97.94 72. Four Seasons Hotel Seoul: Seoul, South Korea Courtesy of Four Seasons Hotel Seoul Modern and sleek, this Four Seasons property is one of three on this year’s top 100.

(tie) Alila Hinu Bay: Salalah, Oman Courtesy of Alila Hinu Bay This 112-key, modern oasis sprawls across more than 100 acres of untouched beachfront property, overlooking the Arabian Sea.

Reader Score: 97.88 75. (tie) Matetsi Victoria Falls: Matetsi Private Game Reserve, Zimbabwe Elsa Young/Courtesy of Matetsi Victoria Falls Set on a nine-mile stretch of land overlooking the Zambezi river, it’s no wonder this property moved up a spot on our readers’ favorite Africa resorts list, taking home the No. 1 spot. Guests have first-hand access to the largest waterfall in the planet and prime viewing of the freely roaming wildlife, plus luxury suites and private villas to come home to. Reader Score: 97.88 75. (tie) The Willcox: Aiken, South Carolina Peter Frank Edwards/Courtesy of The Willcox With its 23 rooms and suites — and quintessential Southern charm — this former estate has lured in discerning travelers for more than a century.

Reader Score: 97.88 78. (tie) Singita Grumeti: Tanzania Adriaan Louw/Courtesy of Singita This 350,000-acre tract has been a biodiversity success story for more than 30 years; today, Singita operates a series of lodges — each a study in wild luxury — across the preserve, as well as a mobile tented camp, Singita Explore, which follows the migrations across the seemingly endless plains.

WBA Hall of Fame honoree. Reader Score: 97.87 80. Thornybush Game Lodge: Thornybush Private Game Reserve, South Africa Courtesy of Thornybush Game Lodge Being one of the first camps in South Africa, Thornybush excels in delivering first-hand safari experiences. This year, guests particularly enjoyed the recently renovated 16 luxury suites, the brand new Kamara House spa, and the attentive service. Exhibit A of the staff’s attention to detail: On a recent mother-daughter trip, two voters were treated “like royalty” to a “special surprise evening where the two of us dined in the library after returning from an evening safari.” Reader Score: 97.83 81. The Standard, Hua Hin: Hua Hin, Thailand Courtesy of The Standard, Hua Hin The perennially hip brand brought some fresh attention to the Hamptons of Thailand, as seaside Hua Hin is sometimes called, with this beachy — if not beachfront — resort. The Standard “channels the brand’s Hollywood roots with Midcentury Modern architecture and quirky Thai trimmings, like vintage train-station benches in the lobby,” contributor Chris Schalkx wrote for T+L in 2022. A handful of villas, many with private pools, offer a touch more privacy while still being part of the scene. Reader Score: 97.82 82. (tie) Domaine Des Etangs, Auberge Resorts Collection: Massignac, France Courtesy of Auberge Resorts Collection Set within a picture-perfect 13th-century château on 2,500 acres of French countryside, this fairly new hotel has landed on not one, but three lists as a newcomer to the World’s Best Awards this year. With storybook stone walls, an on-site art gallery, Hermès furnishings, and food picked from the surrounding farmlands, what’s not to like? Reader Score: 97.80 82. (tie) J.K. Place Roma: Rome, Italy Christos Drazos/Courtesy of J.K. Place Roma Set in a 17th-century building that once housed Rome’s school of architecture, this hotel was voted the No. 1 hotel in the Eternal City by our readers this year. And it’s no wonder why: The eye-catching design makes you feel like you’re staying in a chic townhouse, and it’s within walking distance to the Trevi Fountain and the must-shop boutiques of Via del Corso. Reader Score: 97.80 84. Baoase Luxury Resort: Willemstad, Curaçao Courtesy of Baoase Luxury Resort New to the list, this independent and family-owned oasis on a private beach in Curaçao has the philosophy of “barefoot elegance.” What caught T+L readers’ attention is the romance-specific offerings, such as a tailored sunset cruise on the hotel’s yacht or a private dinner on the beach. The on-site events team can help tailor a grand proposal or wedding, too. Reader Score: 97.79 85. Quisisana Resort: Lovell, Maine Courtesy of Quisisana Resort From memories of childhood to new family traditions, this 76-year-old lakeside resort instills a sense of playful enlightenment for T+L readers. Sleep under the Maine pines, take in live performances by the talented staff, or grab a stand-up paddle board at the all-inclusive Quisisana — literally translating to “place of healing.” Reader Score: 97.77 86. (tie) The Inn Above Tide: Sausalito, California, Sausalito Courtesy of The Inn Above Tide Just 33 rooms and suites, all overlooking the San Francisco Bay, give this property its reputation as a romantic getaway. In fact, one reader noted, “This is quite likely the most romantic inn in the United States.” For others, it was the amenities, like free bicycle rentals and the nightly wine-and-cheese receptions, that made this escape a winner. Reader Score: 97.75 86. (tie) Jade Mountain: Soufrière, St. Lucia Courtesy of Jade Mountain One of St. Lucia’s most iconic resorts, with epic views of the Pitons from its infinity pools, Jade Mountain is also a low-key leader in a Caribbean-wide locavore movement, with a forest of cacao trees on property and many ingredients — avocado, cashews, mango, and tamarind, among them — sourced from its own estate. Reader Score: 97.75 88. (tie) Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria, Sorrento, Italy Courtesy of Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria Perched on a cliff with views of the Gulf of Naples, this family-owned property has been in business since 1834. While its wrought-iron gates and castle exterior nod to the past, the “unmatched attentive service,” according to one reader, keeps up with the present. And for the first time, after shifting in rank for the past five years, it took the No. 1 spot for hotels in Italy this year, too. Reader Score: 97.71 88. (tie) Mandarin Oriental, Doha: Doha, Qatar Courtesy of Mandarin Oriental, Doha One of two Doha gems on this year’s list, the artfully designed Mandarin Oriental is as exclusive as they come, with 117 rooms, 41 suites, and 91 serviced apartments; a lobby filled with “swaths of marble;” and a spa offering “facials and massages that incorporate local ingredients like frankincense and crushed pearl,” as T+L has reported.

(tie) Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur: Udaipir, India Courtesy of Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur This incomparable Taj, seemingly afloat on the waters of Lake Pichola, is one of the most visually arresting hotels in the world, first built as a royal residence in the 18th century.

(tie) The Imperial New Delhi: New Delhi, India Courtesy of The Imperial New Delhi Opened in 1936 as the first hotel in New Delhi, this Indian palace-inspired site continues to charm with its Victorian architecture, verdant gardens, antique chandeliers, and 235 distinct rooms and suites.

Cavas Wine Lodge: Mendoza, Argentina Courtesy of Cavas Wine Lodge This 18-room property, set amid the grapevines of Mendoza, at the foot of the Andes Mountains, is small but mighty. Its Spanish-colonial style architecture adds comfort to the space, while the top-notch service, farm-to-table dining with a nightly-changing menu, and innovative spa — featuring treatments involving vine and grape seed extracts — lead one voter to describe the Lodge as “our home away from home.” Reader Score: 97.49 95. (tie) Angama Mara: Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya Courtesy of Angama Mara One of Kenya’s dreamiest safari lodges, this cliffside Angama is set above the plains of the Masai Mara, with views that seem to stretch forever.

Reader Score: 97.47 95. (tie) Monasterio, A Belmond Hotel, Cusco: Cuzco, Peru Courtesy of Belmond One of two Cuzco stays on this year’s list, Monasterio is set in a refurbished ecclesiastical complex that dates back to the 1500s, built around a lushly landscaped courtyard.

Alila Villas Uluwatu: Uluwatu, Indonesia Courtesy of Alila Villas Uluwatu True tranquility is a given at this Alila property, offering 65 private villas in an open-layout concept inspired by the coastal views and nearby cliffs.

Reader Score: 97.44 98. Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo: Panama City, Panama Courtesy of Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo An elegant waterfront retreat in the old town, the Sofitel Legend “has the feel of a private club, or maybe a mansion belonging to a rich auntie who happens to serve grilled octopus on her waterfront terrace,” as T+L contributor John Bowe wrote in 2023. The property, which has 159 rooms and suites, has a decidedly nautical flavor — dark wood, brass accents, blue-and-white tile — that befits its setting along the Pacific Ocean, a short drive from the Panama Canal. Reader Score: 97.42 99. Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues Geneva: Geneva, Switzerland Courtesy of Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues Geneva At this centuries-old, lakeside property in Geneva, it’s all in the details. Guests are met with an elegant feel curated by French designer Pierre-Yves Rochon — think gold-trimmed ceilings — Italian fare at Michelin-starred Il Lago, underwater music in the on-site infinity-edge pool, and true Swiss activities curated by staff, like a boat cruise on the lake come summer or paragliding above the Alps. Reader Score: 97.41 100. Hotel Café Royal: London, England Courtesy of Hotel Café Royal Where London’s Mayfair, Soho, and St. James neighborhoods meet, you’ll find the historic Hotel Café Royal.
