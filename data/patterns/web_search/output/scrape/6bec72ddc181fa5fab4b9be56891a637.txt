A graduate of the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Blanchett began her career on the Australian stage. Making her feature film debut in 1997, she came to international prominence for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in the period drama Elizabeth (1998), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. Her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in the biopic The Aviator (2004) won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She later won the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing a neurotic former socialite in the comedy-drama Blue Jasmine (2013). Blanchett's other Oscar-nominated roles were in Notes on a Scandal (2006), I'm Not There (2007), Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007), Carol (2015), and Tár (2022), making her the most-nominated Australian. Her biggest commercial successes include The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Cinderella (2015), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Ocean's 8 (2018), and Don't Look Up (2021). Blanchett has performed in over twenty stage productions. She and her husband, Andrew Upton, were the artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company from 2008 to 2013.

Blanchett has received honorary Doctor of Letters degrees from the University of New South Wales, University of Sydney and Macquarie University. Time named her one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2007. In 2018, she was ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses. Early life and education Catherine Élise Blanchett was born on 14 May 1969 in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe.[5][6] Her Australian mother, June (née Gamble),[7] was a property developer and teacher; and her American father, Robert DeWitt Blanchett Jr., a Texas native, was a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer who became an advertising executive.[8][9][10] They met when Robert's ship broke down in Melbourne.[11] When Blanchett was ten, her father died of a heart attack, leaving her mother to raise the family.[12][13] Blanchett is the second of three children, with an older brother and younger sister.[12] Her ancestry includes English, some Scottish, and remote French roots.[13][14][15] Blanchett has described herself as a "part extrovert, part wallflower" child.[12] During her teenage years she had a penchant for dressing in traditionally masculine clothing, and went through goth and punk phases, at one point shaving her head.[12] She attended primary school in Melbourne at Ivanhoe East Primary School; for her secondary education, she attended Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School and then Methodist Ladies' College, where she explored her passion for the performing arts.[16] In her late teens and early twenties, she worked at a nursing home in Victoria.[17] After high school, she began a Bachelor of business administration at the University of Melbourne. While in Egypt, Blanchett was asked to be an extra as an American cheerleader in the Egyptian boxing film Kaboria (1990); in need of money, she accepted the job.[12][18][19] On returning to Australia, she moved to Sydney and enrolled at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA),[18] graduating in 1992 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.[12] Career 1992–2000: Early work and international breakthrough Blanchett's first stage role was opposite Geoffrey Rush, in the 1992 David Mamet play Oleanna for the Sydney Theatre Company. That year, she was also cast as Clytemnestra in a production of Sophocles' Electra. A couple of weeks after rehearsals, the actress playing the title role pulled out, and director Lindy Davies cast Blanchett in the role. Her performance as Electra became one of her most acclaimed at NIDA.[11] In 1993, Blanchett was awarded the Sydney Theatre Critics' Best Newcomer Award for her performance in Timothy Daly's Kafka Dances and won Best Actress for her performance in Mamet's Oleanna, making her the first actor to win both categories in the same year.[11] Blanchett played the role of Ophelia in an acclaimed 1994–1995 Company B production of Hamlet directed by Neil Armfield, starring Rush and Richard Roxburgh, and was nominated for a Green Room Award.[20] Her first screen appearance was in the 1994 TV miniseries Heartland[21] opposite Ernie Dingo, and she went on to appear in the miniseries Bordertown (1995) with Hugo Weaving, and in an episode of Police Rescue entitled "The Loaded Boy".[22][23] She also appeared in the 50-minute drama short film Parklands (1996), which received an Australian Film Institute (AFI) nomination for Best Original Screenplay.[24][25] Blanchett made her feature film debut with a supporting role as an Australian nurse captured by the Japanese Army during World War II, in Bruce Beresford's film Paradise Road (1997), which co-starred Glenn Close and Frances McDormand.[13] The film made just over $2 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million and received mixed reviews from critics.[26][27] Her first leading role came later that year as eccentric heiress Lucinda Leplastrier in Gillian Armstrong's romantic drama Oscar and Lucinda (1997), opposite Ralph Fiennes.[13] Blanchett received wide acclaim for her performance,[18] with Emanuel Levy of Variety declaring, "luminous newcomer Blanchett, in a role originally intended for Judy Davis, is bound to become a major star".[28] She earned her first AFI Award nomination as Best Leading Actress for Oscar and Lucinda.[29] She won the AFI Best Actress Award in the same year for her starring role as Lizzie in the romantic comedy Thank God He Met Lizzie (1997), co-starring Richard Roxburgh and Frances O'Connor.[18] Blanchett's played a young Elizabeth I in the critically acclaimed historical drama Elizabeth (1998), directed by Shekhar Kapur. The film catapulted her to international prominence, earning her the Golden Globe Award and British Academy Award (BAFTA), and her first Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.[11][20] In his review for Variety, critic David Rooney wrote of her performance, "Blanchett conveys with grace, poise and intelligence that Elizabeth was a wily, decisive, advanced thinker, far too aware of her own exceptional nature to bow to any man. [She] builds the juicy character almost imperceptibly from a smart but wary young woman who may be in over her head into a powerful creature of her own invention."[30] Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Blanchett's performance "brings spirit, beauty and substance to what otherwise might have been turned into a vacuous role",[31] and Alicia Potter writing for the Boston Phoenix stated that, "In the end, Kapur's crown jewel is a tale of twin transformations, that of Elizabeth into one of history's most enigmatic and powerful women, and that of Blanchett into, well, a bona fide screen queen."[32] The following year, Blanchett appeared in Bangers (1999), an Australian short film and part of Stories of Lost Souls, a compilation of thematically related short stories. The short was written and directed by her husband, Andrew Upton, and produced by Blanchett and Upton.[33][34] She also appeared in the Mike Newell comedy Pushing Tin (1999), with her performance singled out by critics,[18] and the critically acclaimed and financially successful film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), alongside Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. She received her second BAFTA nomination for her performance as Meredith Logue in The Talented Mr. Ripley.[13] 2001–2007: The Lord of the Rings and established actor Blanchett appeared in Peter Jackson's blockbuster trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, playing the role of elf leader Galadriel in all three films.[13] The trilogy was a major critical and financial success, earning $2.981 billion at the box office worldwide,[35][36][37] and all three films were later ranked within the top 10 greatest fantasy movies of all time in a poll conducted by American magazine Wired in 2012.[38] In addition to The Lord of the Rings, 2001 also saw Blanchett diversify her portfolio with a range of roles in the dramas Charlotte Gray and The Shipping News and the American crime-comedy Bandits, for which she earned a second Golden Globe and SAG Award nomination.[39] Bandits marked Blanchett's first notable foray into the comedy genre, with Ben Falk of the BBC declaring her and co-star Billy Bob Thornton "a real find as comedians" and calling her performance as an unsatisfied housewife caught between two escaped convicts, "unhinged, though undeniably sexy".[40] In 2002, Blanchett starred opposite Giovanni Ribisi in Tom Tykwer-directed Heaven, the first film in an unfinished trilogy by acclaimed writer-director Krzysztof Kieślowski.[20][41] Her performance in the film as a grieving woman who commits a desperate act of terrorism was highly praised, with Stephen Holden of The New York Times calling it, "the most compelling screen performance of her career" and going on to state, "Although Ms. Blanchett's face has always registered emotion with a mercurial fluidity, the immediacy of feeling she conveys in "Heaven" is astonishing."[42] 2003 saw Blanchett again playing a wide range of roles: Galadriel in the third and final instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture);[43] the Ron Howard-directed western thriller The Missing; Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes, playing two roles (both against herself), for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination;[44] and the biographical Veronica Guerin, which earned her a Golden Globe Best Actress Drama nomination.[20] In 2004, Blanchett portrayed a pregnant journalist chronicling an underwater voyage by an eccentric oceanographer in Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Blanchett won her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2005, for her highly acclaimed portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004).[45] This made Blanchett the first actor in history to win an Academy Award for portraying another Academy Award-winning actor.[46] She lent her Oscar statuette to the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.[47] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote that Blanchett portrayed Hepburn with "lip-smacking vivacity",[48] and Roger Ebert lauded the performance, describing it as "delightful and yet touching; mannered and tomboyish".[49] During her preparation for the role, and at the request of Scorsese, Blanchett reviewed 35-millimetre prints of all of Hepburn's first 15 screen performances to study and memorise her poise, mannerisms and speech pattern.[50] Blanchett spoke of the responsibility of portraying such an iconic star, stating, "Representing Kate in the same medium, film, in which she existed was very daunting. But because she was so private and few people really knew her, we basically know Hepburn through her films. So of course you have to give a nod to her screen persona when playing her."[50] That year, Blanchett also won the Australian Film Institute Best Actress Award for her performance as Tracy Heart, a former heroin addict, in the Australian film Little Fish (2005), co-produced by her and her husband's production company, Dirty Films.[33] Though lesser known globally than some of her other films, the sober and sensitive[51] Little Fish received great critical acclaim in Blanchett's native Australia and was nominated for 13 Australian Film Institute awards.[52][53] In 2006, Blanchett portrayed Hedda Gabler at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the Sydney Theatre Company production of Hedda Gabler, directed by Robyn Nevin.[54] She then starred opposite Brad Pitt in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-lingual, multi-narrative drama Babel, as one half of a grieving couple who get caught up in an international incident in Morocco. Babel received seven Academy Award nominations.[55] She also co-starred in Steven Soderbergh's World War II-era drama The Good German with George Clooney, and the acclaimed psychological thriller Notes on a Scandal opposite Dame Judi Dench.[18][20] Blanchett received a third Academy Award nomination for her performance in the latter film,[56] where she portrays a lonely teacher who embarks on an affair with a 15-year-old student and becomes the object of obsession for an older woman played by Dench. Both Blanchett's and Dench's performances were highly acclaimed, with Peter Bradshaw writing in The Guardian, "Director Richard Eyre, with unshowy authority, gets the best out of Dench and Blanchett and, with great shrewdness, elicits from these two actors all the little tensions and exasperations - as well as the genuine tenderness - in their tragically fraught relationship."[57] In 2007, Blanchett was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World,[58] and appeared on Forbes' Celebrity 100 list.[59] She made a cameo as Janine, forensic scientist and ex-girlfriend of Simon Pegg's character, in Edgar Wright's action comedy film Hot Fuzz (2007). The cameo was uncredited and she gave her fee to charity.[60] She reprised her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2007 sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age directed by Shekhar Kapur, and portrayed Jude Quinn, one of six incarnations of Bob Dylan in Todd Haynes' experimental film I'm Not There. She won the Volpi Cup Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Jude Quinn.[61][62][63] At the 80th Academy Awards, Blanchett received two nominations – Best Actress for Elizabeth: the Golden Age and Best Supporting Actress for I'm Not There – becoming the first actress to receive a second nomination with the reprisal of a role.[64] Of her achievement that year, Roger Ebert said, "That Blanchett could appear in the same Toronto International Film Festival playing Elizabeth and Bob Dylan, both splendidly, is a wonder of acting."[65] 2008–2011: Directing the Sydney Theatre Company Blanchett next appeared in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), as the villainous KGB agent Col. Dr. Irina Spalko.[66] The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences but was a major box office success, grossing over $790 million worldwide.[67] In David Fincher's Oscar-nominated The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, she co-starred with Brad Pitt for a second time, playing the title character's love interest, Daisy Fuller. In the same year, Blanchett voiced the character of Granmamare for the English language version of Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo, released in July 2008.[68] Also in 2008, Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton became co-CEOs and artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company.[69][70] Blanchett returned to acting in the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion.[71][72] A Streetcar Named Desire production travelled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.[73][74] It was a critical and commercial success and Blanchett received acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois.[78] The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, "Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, 'you feel like you're hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time.'"[79] John Lahr of The New Yorker wrote of her portrayal, "with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, [Blanchett] gets it right from the first beat ... I don't expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime."[80] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen",[81] and Meryl Streep declared, "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance."[82] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[83] The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.[84] In 2010, Blanchett starred as Lady Marion opposite Russell Crowe's titular hero in Ridley Scott's epic Robin Hood. The film received mixed reviews from critics[85] but was a financial success, earning $321 million at the worldwide box office.[86] In 2011, she played the antagonist CIA agent Marissa Wiegler in Joe Wright's action thriller film Hanna, co-starring with Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana. In 2011, Blanchett took part in two Sydney Theatre Company productions. She played Lotte Kotte in a new translation of Botho Strauß's 1978 play Groß und klein (Big and Small) from Martin Crimp, directed by Benedict Andrews.[87] After its Sydney run, the production travelled to London, Paris, the Vienna Festival and Ruhrfestspiele.[10] Blanchett and the production received wide acclaim.[93] Blanchett was nominated for the Evening Standard Theatre Awards for Best Actress,[94] and won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role[95] and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.[96] She then played Yelena, opposite Hugo Weaving and Richard Roxburgh, in Andrew Upton's adaptation of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, which travelled to the Kennedy Center and the New York City Center as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.[97] The production and Blanchett received critical acclaim,[100] with The New York Times' Ben Brantley declaring, "I consider the three hours I spent on Saturday night watching [the characters] complain about how bored they are among the happiest of my theatregoing life ... This Uncle Vanya gets under your skin like no other I have seen ... [Blanchett] confirms her status as one of the best and bravest actresses on the planet."[101] The Washington Post's Peter Marks dubbed the production Washington, D.C.'s top theatrical event of 2011.[7] Blanchett received the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production, and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.[96][102] 2012–2016: Blue Jasmine and resurgence in Hollywood Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel in Peter Jackson's adaptations of The Hobbit (2012–2014), prequel to The Lord of the Rings series, filmed in New Zealand.[103] While less critically acclaimed than The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit trilogy was nonetheless a major box office success, earning nearly $3 billion worldwide.[104][105][106] The character of Galadriel does not appear in J.R.R. Tolkien's original novel, but the story was amended by co-writer Guillermo del Toro and director Peter Jackson so that Blanchett could appear in the film trilogy.[107] She voiced the role of "Penelope" in the Family Guy episode "Mr. and Mrs. Stewie", which aired on 29 April 2012, and Queen Elizabeth II in the episode "Family Guy Viewer Mail 2".[108][109] Blanchett returned to Australian film with her appearance in The Turning (2013), an anthology film based on a collection of short stories by Tim Winton.[110] She was head of jury of the 2012 and 2013 Dubai International Film Festival.[111] The Sydney Theatre Company's 2013 season was Blanchett's final one as co-CEO and artistic director.[69][112] In 2013, Blanchett played Jasmine Francis, the lead role in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, co-starring Alec Baldwin and Sally Hawkins. Her performance garnered widespread acclaim, with some critics considering it to be the finest of her career to that point (surpassing her acclaimed performance in Elizabeth).[113] In his review for The Guardian, Mark Kermode proclaimed, "Blanchett takes on the challenge like a peak-fitness runner facing a marathon, ploughing her way through 26 miles of emotional road pounding, with all the ups and downs, strains and tears, stomach turns and heartburns that that entails, a feat that occasionally leaves her (and us) gasping for breath."[114] Peter Travers, reviewing the film for Rolling Stone, called Blanchett's performance, "miraculous", and went on to write, "The sight of Jasmine – lost, alone and unable to conjure magic out of unyielding reality – is devastating. This is Blanchett triumphant, and not to be missed."[115] The performance won her more than 40 industry and critics' awards, including the LAFCA Award, NYFCC Award, NSFC Award, Critics' Choice Award, Santa Barbara International Film Festival Outstanding Performance of the Year Award, SAG Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Independent Film Spirit Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress.[116] Blanchett's win made her just the sixth actress to win an Oscar in both of the acting categories, the third to win Best Actress after Best Supporting Actress, and the first Australian to win more than one acting Oscar.[117][118][119] Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow has since criticised Blanchett and other actresses for working with Allen.[120][121] Blanchett responded, "It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some resolution and peace."[122] On the subject of the Me Too movement, Blanchett said she thinks that "social media is fantastic about raising awareness about issues, but it's not the judge and jury" and the cases "need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted, so someone, who is not in the shiny industry that I am, can use that legal precedent to protect themselves. Always, in my industry or any other industry, they're preyed upon because they're vulnerable."[123][124] In 2014, Blanchett co-starred with Matt Damon and George Clooney in the latter's ensemble film, The Monuments Men, based on the true story of a crew of art historians and museum curators who recover renowned works of art stolen by Nazis.[125] The French heroine Rose Valland was an inspiration for Blanchett's character of Claire Simone.[126] The Monuments Men received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $155 million at the worldwide box office.[127] That year, Blanchett also voiced the part of Valka in the DreamWorks Animation film How to Train Your Dragon 2.[128] The film received critical acclaim and was a box office success.[129] It went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[130][131] Blanchett guest starred on the Australian show Rake, as the onscreen female version of Richard Roxburgh's rogue protagonist, Cleaver.[132] On 29 January 2015, she co-hosted the 4th AACTA Awards with Deborah Mailman.[133] In 2015, Blanchett starred in five films. She portrayed Nancy in Terrence Malick's Knight Of Cups, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival.[134] IndieWire named Blanchett's performance in Knight of Cups one of the 15 best performances in Terrence Malick films.[135] She starred as the villainous Lady Tremaine in Disney's Kenneth Branagh-directed live-action adaptation of Cinderella, to critical acclaim.[136][137] Writing for Time magazine, Richard Corliss declared that "Blanchett [earns top billing], radiating a hauteur that chills as it amuses; the performance is grand without skirting parody."[138] She then starred opposite Rooney Mara in Carol, the highly acclaimed film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt, reuniting her with director Todd Haynes. Blanchett, who also served as an executive producer of the film, drew rave reviews for her performance as the titular character, which was widely cited as one of the best of her career, alongside Elizabeth and Blue Jasmine. Justin Chang of Variety proclaimed, "As a study in the way beautiful surfaces can simultaneously conceal and expose deeper meanings, [Blanchett's] performance represents an all-too-fitting centerpiece for this magnificently realized movie."[139][140] For Carol, Blanchett received again Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA Award nominations.[141][142][143] Blanchett portrayed Mary Mapes opposite Robert Redford's Dan Rather in Truth (2015), a film about the Killian documents controversy. Blanchett's production company was a producing partner for the film.[144] She then starred in Manifesto, Julian Rosefeldt's multi-screen video installation, in which 12 artist manifestos are depicted by 13 different characters all played by Blanchett.[145] The project, and Blanchett, received critical acclaim,[146] with Roberta Smith of The New York Times stating: "If the art world gave out Oscars, Cate Blanchett should win for her tour de force of starring roles in 'Manifesto'".[147] In 2016, Blanchett narrated one of two versions of Terence Malick's documentary on Earth and the universe, Voyage of Time, which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice Film Festival.[148][149][150] 2017–2020: Broadway debut and television success Blanchett starred in the Sydney Theatre Company play The Present, Andrew Upton's adaption of Anton Chekhov's play Platonov, directed by John Crowley.[151] The production debuted in Sydney in 2015, to critical acclaim, and transferred to Broadway in 2017,[152][153] marking Blanchett's Broadway debut.[154] Blanchett's performance during the play's Broadway run received acclaim. Ben Brantley of The New York Times remarked that "Blanchett knows how to hold a stage and, if necessary, hijack it ... Such commanding, try-anything charisma is useful if you're attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or, for that matter, play."[155][156] For her work, Blanchett received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play,[157] a Drama Desk Award nomination,[158] and a Drama League Award nomination for the Distinguished Performance Award.[159] In 2017, Blanchett also appeared in Terrence Malick's Song to Song, shot back-to-back with Knight of Cups in 2012,[160] and portrayed the goddess of death Hela in the Marvel Studios film Thor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi.[161] Thor: Ragnarok was both a critical and financial success, earning $854 million at the worldwide box office.[162] In 2018, Blanchett starred in Ocean's 8, the all-female spin-off of the Ocean's Eleven franchise, directed by Gary Ross, opposite Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling, Helena Bonham Carter, Rihanna and Awkwafina.[163][164][165] The film garnered mainly mixed reviews but was a box office success, earning over $297 million worldwide.[166] She also portrayed Florence Zimmerman in the film adaptation of The House with a Clock in Its Walls directed by Eli Roth[167] and narrated Shannon Ashlyn's award-winning Australian historical fantasy film Sweet Tooth.[168] Blanchett was appointed the president of the jury of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, which took place in May 2018.[169] That year, Forbes listed her as one of world's highest-paid actresses with annual earnings of $12.5 million.[170] Blanchett portrayed a female version of the python Kaa in Andy Serkis' adaptation of The Jungle Book titled Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle (2018). Serkis utilised a mixture of motion capture, CG animation and live-action in the film, and the role of Kaa was written to be much closer to the original character in the short stories by the author Rudyard Kipling, which is as a mentor-like figure for Mowgli.[171] The film was released on Netflix in 2019.[172] In the same year, Blanchett starred in Where'd You Go, Bernadette, an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name, which was directed by Richard Linklater.[173] The film received mostly mixed reviews and made $10.4 million at the box office against a budget of $18 million,[174][175] but Blanchett's performance as the titular character received praise, with Pete Hammond writing in his review for Deadline, "[The film] doesn't quite measure up to expectations, despite a game performance from the incandescent Cate Blanchett, who clearly is the best reason to see this movie."[176] She received her tenth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.[177] Also that year, she reprised her role as Valka in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 92nd Academy Awards.[178][179] In 2020, Blanchett's Dirty Films production company was signed with New Republic Pictures for feature films and FX Networks for television.[180][181] Blanchett returned to television by starring in two miniseries. She played a supporting role in the Australian drama series Stateless, inspired by the controversial mandatory detention case of Cornelia Rau. Stateless was funded by Screen Australia and Blanchett also served as co-creator and executive producer for the series.[182] It aired on the Australian public broadcaster ABC, and premiered internationally on Netflix.[183] Blanchett won two awards at the 10th AACTA Awards for Stateless: Best Guest or Supporting Actress for her performance, and Best Mini-Series for her role as executive producer.[184] Blanchett also headlined and produced the FX/Hulu historical drama miniseries Mrs. America (2020), starring as conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly.[185] The nine-part series aired to widespread critical acclaim,[186][187] with James Poniewozik writing in his review for The New York Times, "Her final scene, wordless and devastating, might as well end with Blanchett being handed an Emmy onscreen";[188] and Michael Idato for The Sydney Morning Herald proclaiming, "Blanchett's track record speaks for itself, but here something else is happening. Every time Blanchett's Schlafly glides perfectly into the frame, there is simply nowhere else to look."[189] At the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, she received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Outstanding Limited Series, as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild Award (both for her performance), and the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama.[190][191][192][193] Blanchett also served as an executive producer on the Greek film Apples (2020), directed by Christos Nikou.[194] The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival to critical praise,[195][196] and was selected to be the country's submission to the Academy Awards as their Best Foreign Language Film.[197][198] 2021–present: Tár and further acclaim In 2021, Blanchett starred alongside Bradley Cooper in Guillermo del Toro's film adaptation of the novel Nightmare Alley, which was released to positive reviews[199][200] and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.[201] She also appeared alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio in Adam McKay's Don't Look Up, an apocalyptic political satire black comedy film for Netflix,[202] which also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.[201] With Nightmare Alley and Don't Look Up's Best Picture Oscar nominations, Blanchett broke the record held by actress Olivia de Havilland of being the female actor with the most credited roles in Best Picture nominees.[203] Blanchett then starred in the 2022 film Tár, directed by Todd Field. Her performance as Lydia Tár, a fictional renowned conductor, received widespread critical acclaim.[204] The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney wrote that Blanchett gives an "astonishing performance — flinty, commandingly self-possessed and ever so slowly splintering under pressure", adding that it "marks yet another career peak for Blanchett – many are likely to argue her greatest".[205] For her performance, she won her second Volpi Cup for Best Actress, fourth Golden Globe Award, and fourth BAFTA Award.[206][207][208] She also swept the major critics awards trifecta (NYFCC, LAFCA, NSFC) for the second time and went on to receive her eighth Oscar nomination, tying for the fourth most Oscar-nominated actress.[209][210] That year, Blanchett also voiced Spazzatura in the Netflix film adaptation Pinocchio, reuniting her with del Toro.[211] In 2023, Blanchett co-starred in the Australian drama film The New Boy,[212] and reprised the role of Hela in the season two episode "What If...

The film premiered to negative reviews from critics and became a box-office bomb.[216] She then headlined the Apple TV+ psychological thriller miniseries Disclaimer, written and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, and co-starring Kevin Kline, Sacha Baron Cohen and Louis Partridge.[217] It premiered in October to a mostly positive critical reception.[218][219] Blanchett will next produce and star in A Manual for Cleaning Women, based on Lucia Berlin's 43-part collection of short stories.[220][221] Reception Blanchett is regarded as one of the finest and most versatile actors of her generation.[236] She is noted for her ability to play characters from many different walks of life, and for headlining and being an ensemble player in a wide range of film genres and production scales, from low-budget independent films to high-profile blockbusters.[240] She has also been praised for her mastery over a wide array of diverse accents, including English, Irish, French, and various regional American accents.[242] In a 2022 readers' poll by Empire magazine, Blanchett was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time.[243] Commenting on her appeal as a screen actor in Vulture, Will Leitch and Tim Grierson stated that her greatest skill was "her ability to combine relatability and elusiveness: She is always completely present and yet just out of grasp. She has been forever daring, uncompromising and perpetually, resolutely, herself."[237] Blanchett's performance in the film Carol was ranked as the 2nd best movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019. Writing of her performance in the film, Christian Zilko states, "The greatest performance in a career where almost every role feels like a legitimate contender, Cate Blanchett's take on Carol Aird is a veritable symphony of repressive silence."[244] Blanchett has been cited in the press as being a style icon and has frequently topped lists of the best dressed women in the world.[245][246][247] In 2004, Blanchett was named the third most naturally beautiful woman of all time by a panel of beauty and fashion editors, make-up artists, model agencies and photographers, behind Audrey Hepburn and Liv Tyler.[248] She was in Empire's list of the "100 Sexiest Movie Stars of All-Time" in 2007 and 2013.[249][250] In 2022, she was named in The Hollywood Reporter's listing of "Women in Entertainment Power 100".[251] In 2006, a portrait of Blanchett and her family painted by McLean Edwards was a finalist for the Art Gallery of New South Wales' Archibald Prize.[252] Another portrait of Blanchett was a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2014.[253] Blanchett appeared in a series of commemorative postage stamps called Australian Legends in 2009, in recognition of the outstanding contribution made to Australian entertainment and culture.[254] In 2015, Madame Tussauds Hollywood unveiled a wax statue of Blanchett draped in a recreation of the yellow Valentino dress she wore to the 77th Academy Awards in 2005.[255] In 2019, Blanchett was among the "10 inspirational women honored with a larger-than-life bronze sculpture" as part of the Statues for Equality project, which "aims to balance gender representation in public art and honor women's contributions to society". The bronze statues were unveiled on Women's Equality Day: 26 August 2019 on Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Blanchett's statue is "a creation based on a single image from the 2003 photoshoot by Matt Jones for Movieline's Hollywood Life magazine."[256][257] Activism Environmental Blanchett has been a long term proponent of individual and collective action on climate change and other environmental issues. In 2006, she joined former US Vice-president Al Gore's Climate Project.[258][259] In 2007, Blanchett became the ambassador for the Australian Conservation Foundation.[260][261] She was made an honorary life member of the Australian Conservation Foundation in 2012, in recognition of her support for environmental issues.[258] At the beginning of 2011, Blanchett lent her support for a carbon tax.[262] She received some criticism for this, particularly from conservatives.[263][264] Blanchett is a patron of the international development charity SolarAid, which works to create a sustainable market for solar lights in Africa.[265] From 2008 to 2011, the Sydney Theatre Company under the leadership of Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton, initiated a comprehensive large scale environmental program called Greening the Wharf, which invested in solar energy, rainwater harvesting, energy efficiency measures and best practice waste management.[266] The program won a Green Globe Award which was accepted by Blanchett and Upton.[267] In January 2014, Blanchett took part in the Green Carpet Challenge, an initiative to raise the public profile of sustainable fashion, founded by Livia Firth of Eco-Age.[268][269] In September 2020, as part of her role as Jury President of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, Blanchett vowed that during the festival she would only wear outfits that she had previously worn at public events in an effort to highlight the issue of sustainability in the fashion industry.[270] In October of the same year, Blanchett was appointed by Prince William as a council member for the Earthshot Prize, which provides 50 environmental pioneers with the funds needed to further their work in tackling major problems impacting the environment.[271] In 2022, Blanchett launched the Climate of Change podcast on Audible together with Danny Kennedy to discuss climate change and the importance of preserving the environment.[272][273] The ecohouse that Blanchett and Upton are having built in Mawgan Porth, Cornwall, on the site of a stone cottage they bought for £1.6 million and then demolished,[274] has been the subject of controversy, as the noise from its construction is alleged to have "destroyed the family holidays" of a number of people in 2023.[275] The couple's application to build an extension and space for parking had been described by a local resident as a "blatant attempt to erode an environmentally important piece of land by stealth and incorporate it".[275] The architects developing the site denied that anyone has been inconvenienced by the noise.[275] Humanitarian Like you, I have heard the gut-wrenching accounts. Stories of grave torture, of women brutally violated, people who have had their loved ones killed before their eyes. Children who have seen their grandparents locked in houses that were set alight. I am a mother, and I saw my children in the eyes of every single refugee child I met. I saw myself in every parent. How can any mother endure seeing her child thrown into a fire? – Part of Blanchett's address to the United Nations Security Council about the Rohingya refugee crisis in August 2018.[276] Blanchett has been working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since 2015. In May 2016, the UNHCR announced her appointment as a global Goodwill Ambassador.[277] Blanchett, along with other celebrities, featured in a video from the UNHCR to help raise awareness to the global refugee crisis. The video, titled "What They Took With Them", has the actors reading a poem written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR's "WithRefugees" campaign, which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education.[278][279] Blanchett has undertaken missions with the UNHCR to Jordan in 2015, Lebanon in 2016 and Bangladesh in 2018 to meet with and highlight the issues faced by both Syrian and Rohingya refugees in those areas.[280] In January 2018, she was awarded the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum to honour her advocacy for refugees and displaced people around the world,[281] and in August 2018, she addressed the United Nations Security Council about the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar.[282] In July 2020, the Australian miniseries Stateless, which was co-created and produced by Blanchett (and originally aired on the ABC network in Australia), premiered on Netflix. The series was inspired by Blanchett's work with the UNHCR and focuses on four strangers whose lives collide at an immigration detention centre in Australia. In Blanchett's words, the show's aim is to "build empathy and understanding for refugees, particularly those who have been and still are in detention."[283] As an esteemed member of the performing arts community that was seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a person concerned about environmental and humanitarian issues, Blanchett contributed an essay to Upturn: A Better Normal After COVID-19, a book published in 2020 about what could be done to improve society after the pandemic in her native Australia.[284][285] Blanchett said: We engage with the performance of the gesture and the whole of it is greater than the sum of its parts. I think this need to gather is fundamental to who we are, and it has been stymied by Covid-19 but also underlined by it, and that need in us for community addresses the difficult lesson we have to learn: business is not government and government is not a business.[285] In May 2020, Blanchett was among the celebrities who read an installment of Roald Dahl's children's fantasy novel James and the Giant Peach in aid of the global-non profit charity Partners In Health, co-founded by Dahl's daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas.[286] In September 2020, Blanchett, Helen Mirren, Eddie Redmayne, Salman Rushdie and other figures of British cultural life support the protests of University for Theater and Film Arts (SZFE) students in Budapest against changes ushered Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government that forced a transfer of control of the public institution to a private foundation and a new structure to guide key decisions at the storied SZFE.[287][288] In October 2023, Blanchett signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter calling for a ceasefire during the Israel-Hamas war.[289] Personal life Blanchett is married to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in Australia in the mid-1990s and married on 29 December 1997.[294] They have three sons,[295][296][297] and a daughter, who was adopted in 2015.[298][299] Blanchett said that she and her husband had wanted to adopt since the birth of their first son.[300] After making Brighton, England, their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006.[301][302] In November 2006, Blanchett attributed the move to their desire to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have a sense of belonging to the Australian theatrical community.[303] She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill,[304] extensively renovating their home in 2007 to be more eco-friendly.[305] Following its sale in 2015, she and Upton purchased a house in Crowborough, East Sussex, in early 2016.[306] Blanchett has spoken about feminism and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 that she was concerned that "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" was threatening women's role in society.[307] She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: "Honestly, I think about my appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about the golden age of Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date."[308] Blanchett was the first ambassador and has been a patron of the Australian Film Institute and its academy, the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts, since 2001.[309] She is also a patron of the Sydney Film Festival.[310] Blanchett is a patron of the new Australian Pavilion in the Venice Biennale, and spoke at its opening at the Venice Giardini in May 2015.[311] Blanchett spoke at former Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam's state funeral in 2014, and at the Margaret Whitlam dinner and fundraiser event hosted by politician Tanya Plibersek in June 2015.[312] Blanchett became a spokeswoman for and the face of SK-II, the luxury skin care brand owned by Procter & Gamble, in 2005,[313][314] and brand ambassador for Giorgio Armani fragrances for women in 2013, being paid $10 million for the latter.[315] In 2018 Armani announced Blanchett would become the first beauty ambassador for the company, representing the company globally by absorbing responsibilities for skincare and make-up, in addition to her previous 2013 commitments to fragrances.[316][317] In 2022, Louis Vuitton announced Blanchett as its new house ambassador.[318] Acting credits and awards Blanchett has appeared in over 70 films and over 20 theatre productions. As of 2019[update], Blanchett's films have grossed over $9.8 billion at the worldwide box office.[319] Her highest-grossing films include The Lord of the Rings (2001–2003) and The Hobbit (2012–2014) trilogies, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), Cinderella (2015), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), and Ocean's 8 (2018). Among her numerous accolades for her acting work, Blanchett has won two Academy Awards,[320][321] four BAFTA Awards,[322] four Golden Globe Awards,[323] and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.[324][325][326] Her performance as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator made her the only actor to win an Academy Award for portraying an Academy Award-winning actor.[327][328] Blanchett is one of only four actresses to win the Academy Award for Best Actress after winning Best Supporting Actress.[118] She is the only actress (and one of only six actors) in Oscar history to be nominated twice for playing the same role in two films (Elizabeth I for Elizabeth and Elizabeth: The Golden Age), and the eleventh actor to receive two acting nominations in the same year.[64][329] She is also the only Australian to win two acting Oscars.[330] Blanchett was also the first, and remains the only, woman born in Australia to win an acting Oscar.[b] Blanchett has been recognised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances: Blanchett received Premiere magazine's Icon Award in 2006.[331] In 2008, she received the Santa Barbara International Film Festival Modern Master Award in recognition of her accomplishments in the film industry.[332] That year, she received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, inducted at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard outside Grauman's Egyptian Theater.[20] She received Women in Film and Television International's Crystal Award for excellence in the entertainment industry in 2014.[333] In 2015, Blanchett was honoured at the Museum of Modern Art's Film Benefit for her outstanding contributions to the industry.[334][335] She received the British Film Institute Fellowship in recognition of her outstanding contribution to film, presented to her by fellow actor Ian McKellen.[336][337] Blanchett was also the recipient of the AACTA Longford Lyell Award in 2015, for her "outstanding contribution to the enrichment of Australia's screen environment and culture."[338] In 2016, she received the Costume Designers Guild Lacoste Spotlight Award, in honour of an "enduring commitment to excellence" and her "appreciation for the artistry of costume design and collaboration with the Costume Designers."[339] Blanchett was awarded the Centenary Medal for Service to Australian Society by the Australian government.[340] In 2012, she was appointed Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Minister of Culture, in recognition of her significant contributions to the arts.[341] In 2017, Blanchett was made a Companion of the Order of Australia by the Queen for "eminent service to the performing arts as an international stage and screen actor, through seminal contributions as director of artistic organisations, as a role model for women and young performers, and as a supporter of humanitarian and environmental causes."[4][342] She has been presented with honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales and Macquarie University in recognition of her contribution to the arts, philanthropy and the community.[340][343] In 2022, she received the Honorary César award from the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma for her "absolutely remarkable career and personality".[344] At the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival, she was named the recipient of the Share Her Journey Groundbreaker Award, which is presented to women who have made a positive difference in improving conditions for women in the film industry.[345] See also Notes References Further reading External links

Early life and career Blanchett grew up in suburban Melbourne with an Australian mother and an American father, who died when Blanchett was 10 years old. She studied art history at the University of Melbourne before graduating from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992. Her professional acting career began on the Australian stage. She performed with the Sydney Theatre Company in Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls and Timothy Daly’s Kafka Dances. In 1993 she starred opposite Geoffrey Rush in David Mamet’s Oleanna, as a student who accuses her teacher of sexual harassment. Films: Elizabeth and the Lord of the Rings series Blanchett made her television debut in 1993, and she soon landed leading roles in the miniseries Heartland (1994) and Bordertown (1995). She moved to feature films with Paradise Road (1997), a historical drama about a Japanese war camp in World War II. Blanchett’s reputation grew with her next two feature films: the bittersweet romantic comedy Thank God He Met Lizzie (1997; later released as The Wedding Party) and Oscar and Lucinda (1997), in which she played a rebellious heiress ostracized from Australian society. Her breakthrough role was as young Queen Elizabeth I in the 1998 film Elizabeth, which earned her an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award for best actress. Blanchett was praised for capturing the emotional complexity of the queen’s development from a lovestruck adolescent to an indomitable political force who represses her emotional vulnerability. Blanchett subsequently appeared in films that covered numerous genres and character types, securing her reputation as a versatile actress. She took supporting parts in Pushing Tin (1999), a comedy about air traffic controllers, and in the dramatic thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). As the lead character in The Gift (2000), she played a psychic whose visions involve her in the investigation of a local woman’s murder. In 2001 she portrayed a kidnapped housewife who falls in love with her captors in Bandits. She next appeared as the elf queen Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001, 2002, and 2003), the film adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic fantasy. In the western The Missing (2003), Blanchett brought her trademark complexity to the role of a young woman forced to confront her estranged father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) in order to reclaim her kidnapped daughter. She earned further critical acclaim for her performance as an Irish journalist who runs afoul of the mob in Veronica Guerin (2003). In 2004 she starred in Wes Anderson’s offbeat comedy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, playing a pregnant reporter in a bizarre love triangle with the ship’s captain (played by Bill Murray) and someone who may be his son (played by Owen Wilson).

In the unconventional biopic I’m Not There (2007), she starred as one of several characters based on the musician Bob Dylan at different stages in his life.

Her performance in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine (2013), as a socialite struggling to cope with a decline in circumstances, won her further acclaim, including an Oscar for best actress; she also received her third Golden Globe. She played a French art historian and Resistance member in The Monuments Men (2014), which fictionalized Allied efforts to recover art stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Blanchett then sank her teeth into the role of the wicked stepmother of the title character in Cinderella (2015). In Truth (2015) she played CBS producer Mary Mapes, who was fired after the accuracy of a segment by reporter Dan Rather on U.S. Pres. George W. Bush’s military service was called into question.

CONTENT:
Cate Blanchett Fan @Cate-Blanchett.com Biography Biography Catherine Élise “Cate” Blanchett was born on May 14, 1969 at the Jessie McPherson Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Her father, Robert “Bob” Blanchett, was a Texan and ex-US Navy man who’d met Cate’s mother, a teacher named June, while Bob’s ship, USS Arneb, was in Melbourne. The couple fell in love and Bob moved into advertising in Melbourne. His American accent made him an exotic figure to his elder daughter as she grew up in Melbourne. Cate has two siblings: an her older brother, Bob, is a computer systems engineer, and her younger sister, Genevieve, worked as a theatrical designer and received her Bachelor of Design in Architecture in April 2008. According to Cate, there is some French ancestry in their heritage, one antecedent being Louis Bleriot, the first aviator to fly across the English Channel. A tragedy struck Cate’s life at a young age when her father Bob Blanchett died in a cinema from a heart attack at the age of 40. Cate was mere 10-years old at the time. “The night of the day he died, I thought, Wow — I’m up so late, and I haven’t eaten all day,” she recalls. “It’s hard to compute something so massive. I just sort of rolled with it. You sort of see it from other people’s perspective. I could see that my sister was so young, and I felt it was tragic that she might not remember him. I could see how it affected my brother, who was 11 or 12. I saw what a struggle it was for my mother. I think about my father and how sad it was that he never had grandchildren.” But she utters not a word about her own grief. “Maybe this is just me trying to live with the loss.” At the hospital, Cate was left in a room with one of her dad’s co-workers who told the kids: “This is going to be a very, very hard time for your mother. You have to be very, very good.” Cate believes that this “framed my whole relationship with the family.” It also made her a perfectionist. When Bob died suddenly, the mystique Cate felt towards her father increased. She did not see his body. Cate once said she imagined for a while he had been abducted by the CIA – although she now insists she was joking to the interviewer. But she must have had unfinished business with her father? “I guess so. I mean, it’s hard to say. When you’re 10 years old you don’t really – I mean, children assimilate those changes perhaps more than if it had happened to me when I was 21.” That loss left Cate with an enduring sense that “the presence of death can coexist in life. I just don’t take things for granted. I know that time is very short.” Cate and her siblings were raised by June following Bob’s death. Cate has described her childhood as normal, while seeing herself as “part extrovert, part wallflower.” The extrovert part was fuelled early when, at a friend’s birthday party at age 6, she was hugely impressed by a magician and began to dream of life as a performer. Her parents encouraged her, particularly in the field of music. She has a great love for classical music, even now appearing regularly on ABC Classic FM radio in Sydney, both playing and discussing. Blanchett attended a primary school in Melbourne at Ivanhoe East Primary School. For her secondary education, she attended Ivanhoe Girls’ Grammar School and then Methodist Ladies’ College, from which she graduated, where she explored her passion for acting. She became the school drama captain, appearing in many shows, including The Odyssey of Runyon Jones, and directing her fellow students in a production of They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? She also studied Economics and Fine Arts at the University of Melbourne. Blanchett discovered the pleasures of playacting long before her father died, but she never intended to make it her career. “Acting was fun, but I don’t think it crossed my mind that I could do it,” she says. “I thought the most important thing was security, because of my mother; it was insecure bringing up three children by herself. I thought, I want to do something more practical, so I decided to study economics and fine arts.” After studying at the University of Melbourne she left Australia to travel overseas and gain life experience. Visiting England at the age of 18, Cate was forced to leave when her visa expired, and she moved on to Egypt. A fellow guest at a hotel in Cairo asked if she wanted to be an extra in a movie, and the next day she found herself in a crowd scene cheering for an American boxer losing to an Egyptian in the film Kaboria, starring the Egyptian actor Ahmad Zaki. She dreaded the experience and walked off from the movie. However, Cate found she couldn’t get away from acting, and she ended up studying in Sydney at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. “It was inescapable,” she says. “I loved the looseness and freedom. Some ideas, like what you’re going to do with your life, take time to form. When something is a vocation, you don’t really make a decision about it.” During Cate’s final year at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992, she starred in a production of Sophocles’ Electra and made one very important fan. Her drama teacher and director, Lindy Davies, was then sharing a house with another actor, Geoffrey Rush, and urged him to come see this “astonishing young woman”. He did – and he never forgot Cate’s performance. After graduating from NIDA, Cate joined the Sydney Theatre Company in 1993 for a production of Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls, then moved on to play the bride Felice Bauer in Timothy Daly’s Kafka Dances. Her spectacular work was noted immediately as she won the Best Newcomer of 1993 Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle. Her first major stage role was opposite Geoffrey Rush in the 1993 David Mamet play Oleanna. She played Carol in the controversial and demanding play, in which a university professor is accused of sexual harassment by a student. Initially believing the play to be “a misogynist piece of crap”, she did it because it made her so angry – moving people was, after all, what she wanted to do. It worked. Cate was named Best Actress, becoming the first to ever win Best Newcomer and Best Actress in the same year. Between 1994 and 1995 she also appeared as Ophelia in an acclaimed Company B production of Hamlet, directed by Neil Armfield, starring Rush and Richard Roxburgh. It was clear that Cate was making waves and taking names as a serious stage actress in her home country. Cate also co-starred an episode of Police Rescue entitled “The Loaded Boy”, in 1993. She also appeared in the 1994 television movie of Police Rescue as a teacher taken hostage by armed bandits, and in the 50-minute drama Parklands (1996), which received a limited release in Australian cinemas. Cate next starred in the eight-episode TV miniseries Heartland (1994) opposite Ernie Dingo, which won the AFI Award for Best Direction in a Television Drama. In the show, the mysterious death of an Aborigine girl in a small coastal town brought bigotry into the spotlight. As divorcee Beth Ashton, conducting an affair with an Aborigine Liaison Officer, Cate stirred up controversy. Heartland was described as ABC’s “most significant production to date”. She next appeared in ten episodes of Bordertown (1995), with Hugo Weaving, a miniseries set in a 1950’s migrant camp peopled by European immigrants. In 1994 Cate also appeared in an episode of G.P., titled Natural Selection. 1997 was a big year for Blanchett, who made her international film debut with a supporting role as an Australian nurse captured by the Japanese Army during World War II in Bruce Beresford’s Paradise Road, which co-starred such big names as Glenn Close and Frances McDormand. Cate’s first leading role in a movie, also in 1997, was the role of Lucinda Leplastrier in Gillian Armstrong’s Oscar and Lucinda, opposite Ralph Fiennes. Interestingly, Peter Carey, the Booker Prize-winning Australian author of Oscar and Lucinda, had known Blanchett’s father, Bob, when both worked in the advertising industry in Melbourne. Blanchett was nominated for her first Australian Film Institute Award as Best Leading Actress for the role. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. Cate herself did, however, win an AFI Award as Supporting Actress in 1997 for her role as Lizzie in the Australian romantic comedy Thank God He Met Lizzie, co-starring Richard Roxburgh and Frances O’Connor. The director, Cherie Nowlan, had had her eye on Cate for some time, having spotted her in Kafka Dances a couple of years before. “I couldn’t stop looking at her,” Nowlan later recalled. “She’d covered her face in white pancake makeup, but I could see that underneath she was very beautiful. It was a performance from a pretty original, unusual actor. And, like everyone else, I thought ‘This girl will go off – it’s just a matter of time’.” Cate met her future husband Andrew Upton in the mid-90s as members of Sydney’s small theater community but got to know each other on a film set in 1996 while working on Thank God He Met Lizzie – but it was hardly love at first sight. “It was kind of animosity at first,” Blanchett says. “It was a bit like Beatrice and Benedict.” And yet when they finally got involved, Upton asked her to marry him within a few weeks. Why did she say yes? “I couldn’t not,” she says. “We were in exactly the same place at exactly the same time. He turned to me after a few days and said, ‘Cate…,’ and I thought, Oh, god, he’s going to ask me to marry him — and I’m going to have to say yes! He didn’t, in fact; he asked me what I wanted for dinner or something like that. But I’d never had that thought before. I thought, This is extraordinary! I’ve never felt this before. What an adventure! It was a leap, but I wasn’t leaping by myself. It was a leap into the future.” Now they make decisions jointly, never spend more than a few days apart, and share not just a desk but an e-mail address. “We do live in each other’s pockets a bit,” Blanchett admits, “but that feels natural. It doesn’t feel cramped in there at all.” As for Upton, he says simply: “We sort of clicked. With other people, maybe they don’t get you. But with someone who does, you go, ‘Ooh — I’m got! Someone’s got me!’ It’s a relief and a pleasure.” Cate and Andrew married on December 29, 1997, in the Blue Mountains National Park of New South Wales. Blanchett’s first high-profile international role came as Elizabeth I of England in Shekhar Kapur’s Elizabeth (1998), a film that depicts the early years of the reign of Elizabeth and her difficult task of learning what is necessary to be a monarch. The lead role was reportedly turned down by a number of high profile actresses, including Nicole Kidman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson, Juliette Binoche and Helena Bonham Carter. Blanchett was chosen to play Elizabeth after Kapur saw the trailer for Oscar and Lucinda. She shaved her forehead for just the right look for the role and went through intense research on the monarch. “I researched her letters because I felt that a lot of Elizabeth’s biographies were colored by the historian’s political perspective and how they felt about women. For me, the initial historical source is better to read because there is no barrier between the reader and the historical fact. The more I read about her, however, the more I realized just how large an impact she had on Britain. It’s incredibly humbling as an actor to think of how you could you ever replicate that impact on screen,” she said. Elizabeth premiered in September 1998 at the Venice Film Festival and was also shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film was a great success and Cate’s compelling and powerful performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Unfortunately Blanchett lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow for her role in Shakespeare in Love, but won a British Academy Award (BAFTA) and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama. In 1999, Cate returned to the stage to perform in a charity performance of The Vagina Monologues at the Old Vic in London, alongside Kate Winslet, Julianne Moore, Melanie Griffith and Gillian Anderson. Next Blanchett refused to take big starring roles and instead joined a series of excellent ensembles, prompting her friend and co-star Geoffrey Rush to say: “It suggests that she’s laying down a long-term plan to be an actress, not a star.” She starred in Bangers (1999), a 9-minute short film directed by husband Andrew Upton. Next came Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband (1999), where she played Lady Gertrude Chiltern, the wife of Jeremy Northam. Then there was Pushing Tin (1999), in which Cate played a role radically different again. She played the wife of hot-headed air traffic controller John Cusack and she got herself up in tight pants, gold bracelets and big hair – more Dolly Parton than Elizabeth I – even sporting a special bra for that cleavage emphasizing look. Also in the same year Cate co-starred as Meredith Logue in The Talented Mr Ripley. Director Anthony Minghella really wanted her for the part of a girl who falls for Matt Damon’s sinister lead, but thought she’d refuse a part so small. Liking the script, Cate took it anyway and, once she had, Minghella extended the role to make better use of her. Blanchett was nominated for another BAFTA Award for her supporting role in the movie. In 2000 Cate co-starred in Sally Potter’s The Man Who Cried opposite Christina Ricci, Johnny Depp and John Turturro, playing a Russian cabaret dancer. She starred in Sam Raimi’s horror film The Gift as Annabelle ‘Annie’ Wilson, as a woman with extrasensory perception. She is asked to help find a young woman who has disappeared. Then she starred alongside her Pushing Tin co-star Billy Bob Thornton once again, as Kate Wheeler, a girl kidnapped by two bank robbers played by Billy Bob and Bruce Willis – and winning both their hearts – in the comedy thriller Bandits (2001). Already an acclaimed actress and a household name, Blanchett received a legion of new fans when she appeared in Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings. “I wanted to work with Peter Jackson. The role was oddly secondary and the consequence of playing it was beside the point,” Cate said later on. She played the role of Galadriel, an Elf Queen of power and wisdom who assists the Fellowship, in all three films; The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). The hugely successful trilogy holds the record as the highest grossing film trilogy of all time and went on to win multiple Academy Awards. Cate next took on the title role of Charlotte Gray (2001), an adaptation of Sebastian Faulks bestseller. Cate plays a young Scot who joins the French resistance to save her RAF boyfriend who’s been shot down over France. According to reports, Blanchett and Andrew Upton conceived their first son, Dashiell John, during the filming of the movie. However, at $27 million, Charlotte Gray was the most expensive British film ever made. But, making just $3 million in the UK and only $700,000 in the States, it was a painful financial failure. Cate, however, had delivered another powerful performance and remained untainted by the financial disaster. She moved on to The Shipping News (2001), based on E. Annie Proulx’s bestseller, in which she starred opposite Kevin Spacey. The year 2001 ended on a high note for Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton as the couple welcomed Dashiell John Upton on December 3, 2001 in London. Following the birth of Dashiell, Cate took some time off from work. Her next film project was Heaven (2002), directed by Tom Tykwer from a Kieslowski script. Heaven sees Blanchett as an English teacher in Turin who takes the law into her own hands after police ignore her pleas to arrest the man responsible for her husband’s death. She finds herself not only under arrest for murder but falling in love with an officer. In 2003 Cate played the title role in Joel Schumacher’s Veronica Guerin, an Irish journalist who embarks on a campaign against Dublin’s major drug dealers. The actress found Guerin “so enigmatic and incredibly passionate,” she explains. In addition, Blanchett recalls being “fascinated by the whole socio-political environment she was working in. Most of the films I had seen about Ireland were about the clergy and the IRA. To learn about the rampant drug problem in the 80’s and 90’s, because the government was so concerned about the IRA and the subversives, paramilitaries, the drug barons were left to rampage about unchecked. I was fascinated by the circumstances.” Next Cate starred in the segment “Cousins” in Coffee and Cigarettes (2003), which largely involved characters discussing the likes of movies, art and Paris. Cate would appear in a double role, as a svelte actress and her own gawky, trailer-trash cousin. She next took on the role of Magdalena Gilkeson in The Missing, Ron Howard’s take on a classic Western. Here Cate played frontier rancher and devout Christian, who’s bringing up two daughters on the high plains of New Mexico in the late 1800s. “I saw it the other day and it’s one of the scariest films I’ve seen. It’s pretty unusual for a Ron Howard film,” Cate noted about the film. In late 2003 the actress also kept busy promoting the final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Return of the King. The following year Blanchett moved on to The Life Aquatic (2004), directed by Wes Anderson. This was the tale of a Jacques Cousteau-style documentary maker (Bill Murray) who enjoys a series of wild adventures with his formerly estranged son (Owen Wilson), tracking down a rare shark who killed his crew-mate. Cate played Jane Winslett-Richardson, a pregnant journalist onboard to research and write a profile on Murray’s character, and would become the object of both men’s affections. For her pregnancy scenes she was fitted with a prosthetic belly. However, Cate actually became pregnant with Roman Robert during the filming of the movie. The Blanchett-Upton family welcomed Roman on April 23, 2004, who, like his older brother, was born in London. Before giving birth, however, Cate took on a major co-starring role in Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator (2004), portraying another real person, this time classic screen actress Katharine Hepburn, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio’s Howard Hughes. Cate stepped in for Nicole Kidman who was contracted to a remake of The Stepford Wives and faced the challenge of delivering a believable Hepburn (one of Hughes’ lovers), with Kate Beckinsale taking on Ava Gardner and singer Gwen Stefani trying Jean Harlow. Cate did a huge amount of research on Hepburn having accepted the role. “Firstly I scoured all her films. Scorsese has an encyclopaedic knowledge of cinema and part of the joy was rediscovering Hepburn and Cary Grant on the big screen at his place, analyzing performances which I’d only ever seen on the small screen.” Her research extended to more than just watching classic films: “I read everything written about her. Lauren Bacall was generous with her memories and it was beguiling to be hearing about a friendship between two goddesses.” Yet while there was serious pressure on Blanchett to do justice to one of the silver screen’s best loved stars. “She is beyond legendary as far as I was concerned, but sometimes fear is galvanizing. I knew I had a lot of work to do. To move beyond mimicry and cabaret impersonations and tap into a spirit and create a character – and a full-blooded one – that was the challenge.” Cate found herself – more than deservedly – Oscar-nominated for the second time. This time she won as Best Supporting Actress for her uncanny performance as Katherine Hepburn. This made Blanchett the first person to garner an Academy Award for playing a previous Oscar-winning actor/actress. Off-screen, Cate concentrated on her family, moving from Islington down to the Kemp Town area of Brighton in England. She also modeled clothes for Donna Karan, and became the face of the SK-II skincare range. Following this, Blanchett returned to her home country of Australia to film Little Fish (2005), playing a recovering junkie in Sydney’s Little Saigon area. Cate received further critical praise for her gritty and highly realistic performance. Along with Little Fish, 2005 saw the release of Stories of Lost Souls. The segment, directed by Andrew Upton and filmed back in 1999, is called Bangers and sees Cate in the role of Julie-Anne. 2006 was an extraordinary year, even considering Blanchett’s high standards, with all of her three films being Oscar-nominated. First came Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Babel (2006), which saw Cate co-star opposite Brad Pitt. It depicts a tragedy that strikes a married couple on vacation in the Moroccan desert, touching off an interlocking story involving four different families. The film was nominated for multiple Oscars and won for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Score. Up next was The Good German, Steven Soderbergh’s black and white attempt to make a movie in the style of the 1940s. The film is set in post-war Berlin to cover the Potsdam Conference, where an American military journalist is drawn into a murder investigation which involves his former mistress and his driver. Cate played Lena Brandt opposite George Clooney and Tobey Maguire. The film was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Score. Finally, Cate played Sheba Hart in Notes on a Scandal (2006). Both Cate as well as Judi Dench, the leading lady of the film, were nominated for Oscars for their powerhouse performances in the drama, in which a veteran high school teacher befriends a younger art teacher, who is having an affair with one of her 15-year-old students. In 2007, Blanchett was named as one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World and also one of the most successful actresses by Forbes magazine. In the meantime, having successfully taken the Sydney Theatre Company’s treatment of Hedda Gabler to New York, the Blanchett-Upton would moved their family back to Australia, due to a desire to decide on a permanent home for her children, and to be closer to Cate’s family as well as a sense of belonging to the Australian (theatrical) community. They bought a 1877 sandstone mansion in the harbourside Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. It was purchased for $10.2 million Australian dollars in 2004 and underwent extensive renovations in 2007 in order to be made more eco-friendly. Cate and Andrew continued their theatrical careers at the Sydney Theatre Company. In December Upton directed David Mamet’s one-act Reunion and Blanchett made her directorial debut with Pinter’s one-act A Kind Of Alaska, in which a woman wakes up from a 30-year coma. It was also announced that Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton would become co-artistic directors of the STC, beginning in January 2008. Their first productions would be David Hare’s The Vertical Hour and a vivid Indian adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Cate also continued making movies in 2007. She made a cameo in the British comedy Hot Fuzz, playing the ex-girlfriend of Simon Pegg’s character. Next came Todd Haynes’ extraordinarily unique I’m Not There, a film that used several characters to represent different aspects of musician Bob Dylan’s personality throughout his life and career. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, Marcus Carl Franklin and Richard Gere also played the singer, but it was Blanchett’s performance that truly stood out. Her Jude directly corresponds to the Dylan who plugged in and toured England in 1966, meeting the suspicion of the media and then the open hostility of audiences via that famous “Judas” heckle at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. Director Haynes says that he did not want a woman playing Dylan to be a “cinematic stunt”. At a simple level, though, the physicality of Blanchett’s performance – skipping, hunched and skinny, frazzled by acid and amphetamines – is remarkable. “Dylan was quite spiderlike,” Cate says. She “lost an awful lot of weight” for the role. Cate won the Volpi Cup Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival and the Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe Award for her portrayal. In 2007 Cate also reprised her role as Elizabeth I in the sequel, Elizabeth: The Golden Age. Blanchett was reportedly reluctant to reprise her role in the big-budget sequel, but says that she simply needed persuading that she could delve deeper into Elizabeth I. “It’s indisputable that she’s incredibly complex. If you look at the long legacy of actresses who’ve played her and will continue to play her, it’s a little bit like the female Hamlet.” At the 80th Academy Awards Blanchett received two Academy Award nominations; Best Actress for Elizabeth: the Golden Age and Best Supporting Actress for I’m Not There, breaking more records by becoming the 11th actor to receive two acting nominations in the same year and the first female actor to receive another nomination for the reprisal of a role. In 2008 Cate gave birth to the family’s third son, named Ignatius Martin, on April 13. She appeared in two movies in the year: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. She played the villain, KGB agent Col. Dr. Irina Spalko, opposite Harrison Ford in the Steven Spielberg action blockbuster, in which Dr. Henry “Indiana” Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls. David Fincher’s Benjamin Button saw Cate appear on screen with Brad Pitt for a second time. It is a sprawling epic set in New Orleans that begins in 1918 and ends with Hurricane Katrina, nearly a century later. It runs close to three hours long and was filmed in Louisiana, Canada, the Caribbean, Cambodia, and India, along with Los Angeles. Cate portrayed the character of Daisy throughout many decades, aging from a girl to an old woman and, ultimately, her death. She was drawn to Benjamin Button by the very elements that have caused studio executives to agonize about the open question of its commercial appeal. “David said, ‘This film is about death,’ and I think it’s great,” she says. “We’ve enshrined the purity, sanctity, value, and importance of bringing children into the world, yet we don’t discuss death. There used to be an enshrined period where mourning was a necessary part of going through the process of grieving; death wasn’t considered morbid or antisocial. But that’s totally gone. Now we’re all terrified of aging, terrified of death. This film deals with death as a release. I hope it’s a moment of catharsis.” In 2008 Cate also voiced the character of Gran Mamare in the English version of Ponyo. On December 5, 2008 Blanchett was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre. In 2009 Cate took on the infamous role of Blanche DuBois in Sydney Theatre Company’s staging of A Streetcar Named Desire. The play was directed by actress Liv Ullmann and co-starred Joel Edgerton. Cate won the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production, Washington, DC for her performance. She also appeared in War of the Roses. The following year she starred in Uncle Vanya, which was adapted by Upton and co-starred Richard Roxburgh, John Bell and Hugo Weaving. Cate’s next movie role came in the form of Marion Loxley in Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood (2010), opposite Russell Crowe. She ended up doing more than merely playing a damsel in distress. “I had to do a lot of stunts which certainly tested me,” says Cate. “Ridley said, ‘You can do it if you’re game for it.’ If someone sets you a challenge like that you’re not going to turn around and say, ‘No, I’m not.’ I did a lot of horse riding. I wouldn’t say I’m a master horsewoman but I do like riding a horse. And they are film horses so they’re pretty well trained. It was a thrill in the end.” Robin Hood grossed a huge opening internationally, making $75 million outside North America. Cate was still focusing her duties at the Sydney Theatre Company, in fact, in 2010 Cate and Andrew extended their term as the artistic directors of the STC and she remained in her role until 2013. In 2011, Cate played the ruthless intelligence agent Marissa Wiegler in Joe Wright’s Hanna, which stars Saoirse Ronan. During the two following years, Cate reprised her role of Galadriel in Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit. In 2013, Cate became the face of Armani fragrances and it was reported she signed a 10 million dollar contract to represent the brand. With a successful role as theatre director and brand ambassador, the best was yet to come. Cate received a brief call from Woody Allen where he said “I have this script I want you to read”. After she received it in her home in Australia, she read it and called him back and in what she describes as “an excruciating minute and a half call where I keep talking to him although he clearly didn’t want to”; and both agreed to meet during the summer of 2012 in San Francisco to start shooting. In Blue Jasmine, Cate plays a New York socialite who falls from grace and moves to San Francisco with her distant sister (Sally Hawkins). The film was released in August 23, 2013 and she immediately became the favorite to win an Oscar. Because of the praise by critics and Oscar buzz on her performance as Jasmine French, the movie stayed in the cinemas for almost 7 months. It grossed 97 million worldwide on a production budget of only 18 million dollars. The role, as Cate describes it, was a “synthesis of her work in the theatre” and it earned her more accolades than any other role she has ever played; it holds the record for largest “Best Actress” sweep with 42 winnings, including a second Oscar in her career. In 2014 Cate worked with George Clooney again, this time he was directing her in Monuments Men. She played Claire Simone, a character based on the real life French curator Rose Valland who helped a group of WW2 soldiers commissioned to rescue art work from the Nazi. While filming this movie in Berlin, Cate sat with German filmmaker Julian Rosefeldt to discuss a possible collaboration. Their work would later become Manifesto. In May of the same year, Cate attended Cannes to promote How To Train Your Dragon 2. She lent her voice to Valka, a mysterious dragon rider and mother of Hiccup. When asked about her interest to be part of the film, Cate jokes that director Dean DeBlois “ambushed her” in an Oscar ceremony years before and offered her the role. That same year, Cate received the Doctor of Letters honoris causa from Macquarie University in Sydney, this became her third honorary degree from an academic institution. Meanwhile on television, she appeared in the Australian show “Rake” playing Richard Roxburgh character’s female alter ego and in theatre, she collaborated again with The Sydney Theatre Company in a new adaptation of Jean Genet’s The Maids playing Claire. This stage production had a stellar cast; Isabelle Huppert played opposite Cate as her homicidal sister Solange, with Elizabeth Debicki as the Madam. Th play was part of the Lincoln Center Festival lineup and became the hottest ticket that summer. 2015 was a very prolific year for her with several projects; from playing 13 characters in an experimental exhibit to a live action Disney hit; she became Cinderella’s evil stepmother Lady Tremaine, while in the long awaited Terrence Malick’s Knights of Cups film, she had a small part playing Christian Bale’s ex-wife. During Cinderella’s press week, Cate surprised everyone with a big announcement: she and Andrew had adopted a baby girl in the United States. They named her Edith Vivian Patricia and she joined the family of five in London, “it’s been a remarkable thing watching them welcome her and become a little troupe” said Cate about her boys’ interaction with the new family member. Carol brought Cate and Todd Haynes together again and it became their second film collaboration. Based on Patricia Highsmith’s “The Price of Salt”, Carol tells the story of a forbidden affair between two women in the 50’s: Carol Aird and Therese Belivet. This project faced a lot of difficulties before seeing the light; the script alone took almost 20 years in the making, John Crowley and Luca Guadagnino both passed the project before Haynes accepted to direct it and Mia Wasikowska was first offered the role of Therese Belivet but had to step out due scheduling conflicts and Rooney Mara joined the production. Cate not only played the titular role but she and Andrew became producers through their production company Dirty Films. The film premiered in Cannes and received over full five minutes standing ovation with impeccable reviews; it was described as a “ravishing tour de force” by The Guardian’s film critic Mark Kermode and even called “The best movie of 2015, if not the decade” by film critic David Ehrlich. It got 6 nominations from the Academy, including another Best Actress nomination for Cate. She also received the Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA and Independent Spirit Award nominations for her performance as Carol Aird. During the same year Cate is featured in another movie production: Truth, where she plays Mary Mapes, the former 60 minutes producer fired after reporting an alleged preferential treatment to President George W. Bush during his younger years in the militia and Robert Redford plays anchorman Dan Rather also terminated by CBS. For Cate, working with Robert was an honor and a dream come true, but Robert was marveled by her, “I suspected it was going to be good, but she’s the best. She can do anything – as she’s proven” he told People magazine about his co-star. Another project from the same year came in the form of a multi-screen film installation called Manifesto. Manifesto was shot in 11 days with Cate playing 13 roles; in the Pop Art manifesto segment she is joined by Andrew and their kids, and although Cate has always tried to maintain her family away from her career, she asked them if they’d like to be part of it and, and “they were fantastic, they loved it!”. The installation started touring Europe in summer 2016, reaching then the United Stated and kept touring until summer 2019. The following year the installation was adapted into a film and premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. During the same year Cate was saying goodbye to the Sydney Theatre Company, closing a decade of artistic collaboration: on August 2015 she was on stage with The Present, an adapted screenplay written by her husband based on Checkov’s Platonov. The production will later tour on Broadway, marking Cate’s debut in those theatres and her first Tony Award nomination in 2017. On January 2016, Cate received the Desert Palm Achievement Award from her co-star in Hanna Saoirse Ronan, for her performance in Carol and Truth. That year she spent her time mostly to filming movies scheduled to premiere in 2017. Cate being an artistically curious being, decided to work with Australian figurative painter Del Kathryn Barton on RED, the deadly mating ritual of the red back spider re-enacted by Cate, is the premise if this short film. The short film debutted on January 2017 at the Art Gallery of South Australia. Although this project has been presented in several film festivals and galleries, including New York, has been display mostly in Australia. Thor: Ragnarok also was released in November 2017, this movie marked Cate’s introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She played Hela the Goddess of Death, the first big villainess in the Marvel world. When Cate attended San Francisco’s Comic Con to promote the film, she said it was because her children are big superheroes movie fans that she joined the movie. This was a very demanding physical role, she had to train for months and learn the Brazilian martial art called Capoeira. Cate’s reputation as one of the best and most professional in the business, intimidated some people in the production, including her co-star Chris Hemsworth: “It was wildly intimidating but she is one of my favorite people on the planet, it’s nice to meet your heroes and it be as good as you’d hoped”. The feeling was shared by Ragnarok’s writer Eric Pearson, “The toughest character to write had to be Hela. I think there is a built-in intimidation factor of it being Cate Blanchett, who I would say at the very least is tied with a couple of others for the best in the world”. The movie was a box office hit, making a total of 854 million dollars internationally. Cate Blanchett begins the 2018 by receiving the Crystal Award from the World Economic Forum in Davos for her leadership in raising awareness of the refugee crisis. Later in the year she has been announced as the 12th female president of the Cannes Film Festival’s jury, joining a select group of women that have been honored with this appointment. During the same year she makes her grand return to the cinemas with four featured films: Ocean’s 8, The House With A Clock In Its Walls, Where’d You Go Bernadette and Mowgli, filmed between 2016 and 2017. In 2019 she is lending her voice to Valka one again, in How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, final installament of the saga. Whether is presiding Cannes or visiting refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Rohingya as part of her role as UNHCR goodwill ambassador, or voicing a virtual assistant chatbot that helps people with disabilities, Cate is unstoppable and indefatigable; “I’m never happy … I think in a good way. When I say I’m restless, I think it’s in that Martha Graham kind of divine restless impatience to constantly be moving and looking for the fault in what you’ve done previously. … I’ve learnt far more from my failures than I have from any success I had.” Last updated on May 14, 2018 © Cate-Blanchett.com Do not re-post without our expressed permission.
