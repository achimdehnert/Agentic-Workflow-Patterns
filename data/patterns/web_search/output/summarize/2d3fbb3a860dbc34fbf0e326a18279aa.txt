# Johnny Depp: A Life on Screen and Stage

Johnny Depp is an American actor and musician known for his eclectic and unconventional film roles, often portraying eccentric characters. He has achieved global stardom for his roles in films such as "Pirates of the Caribbean," "Edward Scissorhands," "Sleepy Hollow," and "Finding Neverland." [1, 2, 3] 

Depp's career began in the 1980s as a musician, performing in several amateur rock bands. He later transitioned into acting, making his film debut in "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984). Depp rose to prominence in the late 1980s as a teen idol on the television series "21 Jump Street," but he soon sought out more challenging roles in independent films. [1, 2, 3] 

He established himself as a leading actor in the 1990s with critically acclaimed performances in films like "Benny and Joon," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," "Ed Wood," and "Donnie Brasco." [1] Depp's frequent collaborations with director Tim Burton led to iconic roles in films like "Edward Scissorhands," "Sleepy Hollow," and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." [1, 2, 3] 

In the 2000s, Depp achieved global stardom as Captain Jack Sparrow in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise. [1, 2, 3] His performance earned him widespread acclaim and an Academy Award nomination. [1, 2, 3] He continued to star in critically acclaimed films like "Finding Neverland" and "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," earning him further Academy Award nominations. [1, 2, 3] 

However, Depp's career began to decline in the 2010s, with several big-budget films underperforming at the box office. [1, 2, 3] He also faced negative publicity due to allegations of domestic violence, substance abuse, and poor on-set behavior. [1, 2, 3] 

Depp's personal life has been just as tumultuous as his career, marked by high-profile relationships and legal battles. He was married twice, first to makeup artist Lori Anne Allison (1983-1985) and then to actress Amber Heard (2015-2017). His long-term relationship with French actress Vanessa Paradis (1998-2012) produced two children, Lily-Rose and Jack. [2, 3]

Depp's legal battle with Heard, including a highly publicized defamation trial in 2022, has had a significant impact on his career. [2, 3] 

Despite the controversies, Depp continues to act and make music. He has released two albums with the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires and a collaborative album with guitarist Jeff Beck. [1, 2]  He also recently starred as King Louis XV in the French period film "Jeanne du Barry." [2]
