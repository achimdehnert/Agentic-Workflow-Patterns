# Johnny Depp: Actor, Musician, and Controversial Figure

Johnny Depp is an American actor and musician known for his eccentric film choices and versatile performances. His most notable roles include Captain Jack Sparrow in the *Pirates of the Caribbean* franchise, Willy Wonka in *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, and Ichabod Crane in *Sleepy Hollow*. Depp has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has won a Golden Globe Award for his performance in *Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street*.

Depp began his career as a musician in several rock bands before transitioning into acting in 1984. He gained popularity as a teen idol in the TV series *21 Jump Street* (1987-1990). However, he later resented his teen heartthrob image and sought out more challenging roles in independent films.

Depp's career has been marked by both success and controversy. In the 2010s, he became the highest-paid actor in the world, but his popularity declined following allegations of domestic violence by his ex-wife, Amber Heard. Their defamation trial in 2022 garnered widespread attention.

Depp has continued to act and pursue his musical career, forming the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice Cooper and Joe Perry. He also released a collaborative album with Jeff Beck in 2022.
