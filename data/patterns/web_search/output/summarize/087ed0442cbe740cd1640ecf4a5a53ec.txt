# Will Smith: Actor, Rapper, and Producer

Will Smith is a renowned American actor, rapper, and film producer who has achieved significant success across multiple entertainment industries. His career began in the 1980s with the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, where he gained recognition for his light-hearted and clean rapping style. The duo's 1988 single "Parents Just Don't Understand" won a Grammy Award, making them the first rap act to receive this honor. 

Smith's acting career took off with the sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" in 1990. The show, loosely based on his life, ran for six successful seasons and catapulted him into Hollywood stardom. His big-screen breakthrough came with the action comedy-thriller "Bad Boys" (1995), which grossed over $100 million worldwide. He solidified his position as a bankable star with subsequent films like "Independence Day" (1996) and "Men in Black" (1997).

Smith has demonstrated his versatility as an actor by taking on diverse roles, including the iconic boxer Muhammad Ali in the biopic "Ali" (2001), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, and a single father struggling with homelessness in "The Pursuit of Happyness" (2006), which earned him a second Oscar nomination. His performance as Richard Williams, the father of tennis legends Serena and Venus Williams, in "King Richard" (2021), garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor. 

While Smith's career has been marked by numerous successes, he has also faced controversy. During the 2022 Academy Awards, he slapped presenter Chris Rock after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. This incident led to widespread criticism and Smith's resignation from the Academy, as well as a ten-year ban from attending their events. Despite the controversy, Smith remains a prominent figure in Hollywood, with several upcoming projects, including "Bad Boys: Ride or Die" and a sequel to "I Am Legend."
