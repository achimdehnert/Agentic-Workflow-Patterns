# Will Smith: A Multifaceted Entertainer 

Willard Carroll Smith II, born September 25, 1968, is a renowned American actor, rapper, and film producer [1]. His multifaceted career spans from music to acting, making him a global icon. Smith rose to fame as a rapper in the 1980s with DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, a hip hop duo with his childhood friend Jeffrey Townes [1, 2, 3]. They achieved success with hit singles like "Parents Just Don't Understand" and "Summertime", and even won a Grammy Award [2, 3]. Smith's music, often described as "light rap" due to its lack of hardcore themes, brought him to the attention of television producers [3]. He was cast in the NBC sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", which was loosely based on his life [3]. The show's success marked a turning point in his career, launching him into the world of acting. 

Smith's film career took off with "Bad Boys" (1995) [3]. Despite mixed reviews, the film became a box office hit, establishing Smith as a leading man. He went on to star in blockbuster films like "Independence Day" (1996), "Men in Black" (1997), and "Enemy of the State" (1998) [3]. Smith's versatility as an actor is evident in his diverse range of roles, portraying historical figures like Muhammad Ali in "Ali" (2001) [3] and Chris Gardner in "The Pursuit of Happyness" (2006) [3]. He also starred in science fiction films like "I, Robot" (2004) and "I Am Legend" (2007) [3], and romantic comedies like "Hitch" (2005) [3]. 

Smith's success extends beyond acting and music. He has also established himself as a successful film producer. He co-founded Overbrook Entertainment with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, a production company responsible for films like "The Pursuit of Happyness" and "Bad Boys" [2]. 

In 2022, Smith won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in "King Richard", a biopic about the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams [3]. However, his win was overshadowed by an incident where he slapped comedian Chris Rock on stage during the ceremony [3]. The incident sparked significant controversy and led to Smith resigning from the Academy and being banned from attending their events for ten years [1]. Despite this setback, Smith continues to be a major force in the entertainment industry, with upcoming projects including "Bad Boys: Ride or Die", a sequel to "I Am Legend", and a new solo album [1].
