{"minor_issues": "None.", "overall_recommendation": "Accept with minor revisions.", "strengths": "The article provides a clear and concise explanation of perplexity and its significance in LLM training. The mathematical definition and practical implications are well-articulated.  The discussion on limitations of perplexity as a sole evaluation metric and the need for a holistic approach is insightful.", "summary": "This article offers a comprehensive overview of perplexity, a crucial metric in large language model training. It effectively explains the concept, its calculation, and its role in evaluating and optimizing LLMs. The authors appropriately acknowledge the limitations of perplexity and emphasize the importance of multifaceted evaluation approaches.", "weaknesses": "The article could benefit from a brief discussion of alternative evaluation metrics and their complementary roles alongside perplexity. While acknowledging the limitations, exploring specific examples of tasks where perplexity might not correlate well with real-world performance would further strengthen the analysis."}
