{"minor_issues": "The article could benefit from illustrative examples to further clarify the concept of perplexity and its applications. For instance, showing perplexity scores for different language models on a specific task would provide a practical understanding of its interpretation.", "overall_recommendation": "Minor Revision", "strengths": "The revised article demonstrates a good understanding of the feedback provided and effectively addresses the raised concerns. The inclusion of a dedicated section on limitations of perplexity strengthens the paper and provides a more balanced perspective. The addition of the mathematical formula enhances the technical rigor, and the overall clarity and coherence have significantly improved.", "summary": "The revised article offers a comprehensive overview of perplexity as a measure of language model proficiency. It effectively explains the concept, calculation, significance, and limitations of perplexity. The addition of a mathematical formula and a dedicated section on limitations enhances the article's depth and rigor. However, incorporating illustrative examples would further enhance clarity and practical understanding.", "weaknesses": "While the article explains the concept and calculation of perplexity, it lacks practical examples to illustrate its application. Including examples, such as comparing perplexity scores of different language models or demonstrating how perplexity varies with model training, would significantly enhance the article's clarity and impact."}
