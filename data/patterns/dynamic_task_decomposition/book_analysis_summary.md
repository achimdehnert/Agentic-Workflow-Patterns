## The Old Man of the Sea: A Comedy of Deception and Manipulation

W.W. Jacobs' "The Old Man of the Sea" is a hilarious tale of deception and manipulation, where each character's personality and actions contribute to the escalating comedic chaos.  

**Mr. George Wright:** Driven by his desire to marry Bella, he orchestrates a complex scheme involving the old sailor, Mr. Kemp, as his "rich uncle."  Wright's gullibility and desperation for wealth make him easily manipulated by Kemp's increasingly audacious claims.  His inability to control the situation and his escalating frustration creates the main comedic drive of the story.

**Mr. Kemp:** The old man, presented initially as a simple, trustworthy sailor, is revealed to be a cunning and opportunistic schemer.  Kemp quickly embraces the role of the rich uncle, relishing the attention and free drinks.  He enjoys playing the role of a generous benefactor, further adding to the absurdity of the situation.  His constant desire for more "extravagant" spending and disregard for Wright's financial well-being, coupled with his uncharacteristic affection for Charlie Hills, further contribute to the humor.

**Miss Bella Bradshaw:**  Bella is an innocent, romantic young woman who is easily swayed by the charm of the "millionaire" uncle.  Her naivete and dreams of wealth allow her to become entangled in Wright's deceptive plan, further deepening the comedic irony.  Her eventual realization of the truth, fueled by the blossoming relationship between Mr. Hills and her mother, adds a poignant layer to the comedy.

**Mrs. Bradshaw:**  The mother, initially skeptical of Kemp's wealth, is quickly charmed by his attention and willingness to "spend money like water."  Her desires for a lavish lifestyle fuel her encouragement of Kemp's extravagant behavior, further pushing Wright to his limit. Her eventual realization of Kemp's true nature and her romantic connection with Charlie Hills add a final, amusing twist to the story.

**Charlie Hills:**  This character, introduced as a charming and lively young man, acts as a catalyst for the increasing chaos.  His persistent presence and unyielding flirtation with Bella and Mrs. Bradshaw further disrupt Wright's plan and create a hilarious tension within the small group. His ability to see through Kemp's façade and encourage his extravagant spending adds to the comedic absurdity of the situation.

**Theme of Deception and Manipulation:**  The story showcases the comedic consequences of deception and manipulation.  Wright's desperate desire to win Bella's affection leads him to employ a scheme that ultimately backfires, highlighting the folly of attempting to gain something through dishonest means.  Kemp's willingness to exploit the situation for his own amusement underscores the inherent danger of allowing greed and self-interest to override common sense.

## - Pay particular attention to the contrast between Mr. Wright's ambitious schemes and Mr. Kemp's naivete and tendency to embellish the truth.
You're absolutely right to focus on the contrast between Mr. Wright and Mr. Kemp in "The Old Man of the Sea." It's a key element of the humor in the story. Here's a breakdown:

**Mr. Wright:**

* **Ambitious and calculating:** He's driven by a desire to marry Bella and is willing to manipulate situations to achieve his goal. He crafts a complex scheme involving a fictional rich uncle,  undermining the truth to get ahead.
* **Materialistic:** He values wealth and is obsessed with the idea of being "rich." He prioritizes money and social standing over genuine feelings.
* **Controlling:**  He tries to dictate Mr. Kemp's actions, constantly giving instructions and becoming angry when the old man doesn't follow them.

**Mr. Kemp:**

* **Naive and trusting:** He readily agrees to Mr. Wright's scheme without fully understanding the consequences. He lacks awareness of the potential pitfalls and readily accepts Mr. Wright's explanations.
* **Easily swayed:** He's easily influenced by the admiration of the Bradshaw family and loves to be the center of attention. He's easily flattered and enjoys spending money.
* **Tendency to embellish:** He enjoys exaggerating his past and adding details that make him seem more impressive. This is a major factor in the comic misunderstandings of the story. 

**The Contrast:**

* **Foolish ambition vs. harmless naivety:** Mr. Wright's carefully crafted scheme is ultimately undermined by Mr. Kemp's unintentional actions. Mr. Kemp's lack of sophistication and his tendency to embellish the truth create an absurd and humorous situation.
* **Materialism vs. simple pleasures:** Mr. Wright's desire for wealth is in stark contrast to Mr. Kemp's simple enjoyment of company and a good time. He's happy to spend money, but only because it brings him pleasure, not because he's driven by status.
* **Control vs. going with the flow:** Mr. Wright desperately tries to control the situation, while Mr. Kemp simply goes with the flow, allowing the events to unfold naturally. 

The contrast between these two characters creates a dynamic that drives the humor of the story.
