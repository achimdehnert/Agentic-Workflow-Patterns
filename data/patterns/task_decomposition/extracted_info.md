Here are the direct quotations with speakers and context from the document:

**1. Justice Rehnquist:**

* **Quote:** "We are unable to conclude that Congress intended to compel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct,—to invest those who go on strike with an immunity from discharge for acts of trespass or violence against the employer’s property, which they would not have enjoyed had they remained at work.”
* **Context:**  Discussing the case of *NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.* where the Court set aside a backpay award to employees who engaged in a "sit-down strike" involving unlawful conduct.

* **Quote:** “It is sufficient for this case to observe that the Board has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it may wholly ignore other and equally important [c]ongressional objectives.”
* **Context:** Discussing the case of *Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB* where the Court set aside a backpay award to employees who engaged in a strike that amounted to mutiny.

**2. Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion):**

* **Quote:** “[L]anguage of an opinion” must be “read in context” and not “parsed” like a statute.
* **Context:**  Discussing the interpretation of the statement in *Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB* about employees being "unavailable" for work.

* **Quote:** “we would leave helpless the very persons who most need protection from exploitative employer practices.”
* **Context:**  Quoting Justice Kennedy’s opinion from *NLRB v. Apollo Tire Co.* to illustrate why labor laws must apply to illegal aliens.

* **Quote:**  IRCA does not “undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law, or . . . limit the powers of federal or state labor relations boards . . . to remedy unfair practices committed against undocumented employees.”
* **Context:** Citing a statement from a House Committee Report emphasizing that IRCA does not diminish the Board's remedial authority.

* **Quote:** “The board has not examined this issue in detail.”
* **Context:** Citing a statement made by the Government at oral argument regarding the tension between the NLRA and IRCA.

* **Quote:** “[T]he award provisions of the NLRA are remedial, not punitive, in nature, and thus should be awarded only to those who have suffered harm”
* **Context:** Discussing the question of whether awarding backpay to undocumented aliens might constitute a prohibited punitive remedy.

* **Quote:** “The Board acted “with a discriminating awareness of the consequences of its action” on the immigration laws.
* **Context:**  Describing the Board's careful consideration of both labor and immigration law when reaching its conclusion. 

* **Quote:**  “agency’s position with respect to its regulation during litigation “arrives with some authority.”
* **Context:**  Quoting from the case *Jean v. Nelson* to illustrate the weight given to an agency's position during litigation.

* **Quote:** “And the Board’s position is, at the least, a reasonable one.”
* **Context:**  Concluding that the Board's position is reasonable and therefore lawful.

## Key Terms and Concepts from the Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board Case:

**1. National Labor Relations Act (NLRA):** A federal law that protects the rights of employees to organize and bargain collectively with their employers. It prohibits unfair labor practices by both employers and unions.

**2. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB):**  An independent federal agency created by the NLRA to administer and enforce its provisions.  

**3. Backpay:** Monetary compensation awarded to an employee who was wrongfully terminated or discriminated against. It represents the wages they would have earned during the period of unfair treatment.

**4. Undocumented Alien:** A person living in a country without proper legal authorization to reside there. They are often referred to as "illegal aliens."

**5. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA):** A federal law aimed at controlling illegal immigration into the United States. It makes it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire undocumented workers and for undocumented workers to use fraudulent documents to obtain employment. 

**6. Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB (1984):**  A Supreme Court case that addressed the conflict between the NLRA and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  It ruled that the NLRB's reinstatement and backpay orders could be limited to ensure compliance with federal immigration policy.

**7. Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB (1942):** A Supreme Court case that established the principle that the NLRB’s authority to select remedies for labor violations is limited by other federal statutes and policies. 

**8. Employment Verification System:** A system mandated by IRCA that requires employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of all new hires using specified documents.

**9. Fraudulent Documents:**  False or forged documents, such as birth certificates or social security cards, used by undocumented workers to gain employment.

**10. Mitigate Damages:**  An employee's legal obligation to take reasonable steps to reduce their financial losses after being wrongfully terminated.

**11. Cease and Desist Order:** A legal order issued by the NLRB requiring an employer to stop engaging in unfair labor practices.

**12. Contempt Proceedings:** Legal proceedings initiated when a party fails to comply with a court order. 

**13. Traditional Remedies:**  Traditional legal remedies used by the NLRB to enforce the NLRA, such as cease and desist orders and notice posting.

**14. Reinstatement:**  An order by the NLRB requiring an employer to reinstate a wrongfully terminated employee to their previous position.

**15. Statutory Prohibitions:** Legal restrictions imposed by Congress through legislation.

**16.  Deference:**  The judicial practice of giving weight to the interpretations of statutes and regulations by administrative agencies, such as the NLRB, that are charged with administering those laws.

**17.  Dicta:**  Statements in a judicial opinion that are not necessary to the court’s holding and therefore have less persuasive value than the holding itself.

**18.  Permissive Dicta:** Statements in a judicial opinion that are not necessary to the court’s holding and therefore have less persuasive value than the holding itself. 

**19.  Perjury:**  The act of deliberately lying under oath.

**20.  Borderline Cases:**  Situations in which it is unclear whether a specific action violates the law.

**21.  Incentive:**  A factor that motivates a person to act in a certain way.
