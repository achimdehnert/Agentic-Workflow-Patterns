## Direct Quotations with Speakers and Context:

**1. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the Board's remedial authority
**Quotation:** "We are unable to conclude that Congress intended to compel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct,—to invest those who go on strike with an immunity from discharge for acts of trespass or violence against the employer’s property, which they would not have enjoyed had they remained at work."

**2. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the Board's authority to select remedies
**Quotation:** "It is sufficient for this case to observe that the Board has not been commissioned to effectuate the policies of the Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it may wholly ignore other and equally important [c]ongressional objectives."

**3. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the Board's interpretation of statutes
**Quotation:** “While the Board’s interpretation of the NLRA should be given some deference, the proposition that the Board’s interpretation of statutes outside its expertise is likewise to be deferred to is novel”

**4. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the relevance of the immigration laws
**Quotation:** “For whatever reason,” Congress had not “made it a separate criminal offense” for employers to hire an illegal alien, or for an illegal alien “to accept employment after entering this country illegally.”

**5. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the Board's limited authority
**Quotation:** “In devising remedies for unfair labor practices, the Board is obliged to take into account another ‘equally important Congressional objective’ ”

**6. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the impact of IRCA on the immigration laws
**Quotation:** “[T]he policy of immigration law.”

**7. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the Board's discretion in choosing remedies
**Quotation:** “The Board draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts.”

**8. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the deterrent effects of backpay awards
**Quotation:** “It is the reasonably certain prospect of a backpay award” that leads employers to “shun practices of dubious legality.”

**9. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the purpose of the employment prohibition in immigration law
**Quotation:** “To permit the Board to award backpay could not significantly increase the strength of this magnetic force, for so speculative a future possibility could not realistically influence an individual’s decision to migrate illegally.”

**10. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the impact of the backpay award on the magnetic force of employment
**Quotation:** “To deny the Board the power to award backpay, however, might very well increase the strength of this magnetic force.”

**11. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the application of labor laws to undocumented workers
**Quotation:** “We would leave helpless the very persons who most need protection from exploitative employer practices.”

**12. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing Congress' view on the impact of IRCA
**Quotation:** IRCA does not “undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law, or . . . limit the powers of federal or state labor relations boards . . . to remedy unfair practices committed against undocumented employees”.

**13. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the Board's conclusion
**Quotation:** “The Board reached its conclusion after carefully considering both labor law and immigration law.”

**16. Speaker:** Justice Scalia (Dissenting in Part and Concurring in Judgment in ABF Freight)
**Context:** Discussing the seriousness of the employee misconduct in ABF Freight
**Quotation:** “The perjury statute provides for criminal sanctions; it does not forbid a present or potential perjurer from obtaining a job”.

**17. Speaker:** Justice Scalia (Dissenting in Part and Concurring in Judgment in ABF Freight)
**Context:** Discussing the responsibility of the Department of Justice
**Quotation:** “The Department of Justice officials’ responsibility for prosecuting perjury”.

**18. Speaker:** Justice Kennedy (Concurring Opinion in Apollo Tire Co.)
**Context:** Discussing the importance of applying labor laws
**Quotation:** “We would leave helpless the very persons who most need protection from exploitative employer practices.”

**19. Speaker:** The Government (Oral Argument)
**Context:** Discussing the tension between the NLRA and IRCA
**Quotation:** “[T]he board has not examined this issue in detail.”

**20. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the Government's view on the Board's remedy
**Quotation:** “Justice Breyer says that we should nonetheless defer to the Government’s view that the Board’s remedy is entirely consistent with IRCA.”

**21. Speaker:** Justice Breyer (Dissenting Opinion)
**Context:** Discussing the Government's position on the Board's interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act
**Quotation:** “We did not defer to the Government’s position in any of these cases, and there is even less basis for doing so here since IRCA—unlike the maritime statutes, the Bankruptcy Code, or the INA—not only speaks directly to matters of employment but expressly criminalizes the only employment relationship at issue in this case.”

**22. Speaker:** Justice Beezer (Dissenting in Part in Local 512, Warehouse and Office Workers Union v. NLRB)
**Context:** Discussing the purpose of the NLRA’s award provisions
**Quotation:** “The ‘award provisions of the NLRA are remedial, not punitive, in nature, and thus should be awarded only to workers who have been harmed in a legal sense”

**23. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the sufficiency of alternative remedies
**Quotation:** “This threat of contempt sanctions... provides a significant deterrent against future violations of the [NLRA]”.

**24. Speaker:** Chief Justice Rehnquist (Opinion of the Court)
**Context:** Discussing the need for congressional action
**Quotation:** “in light of the practical workings of the immigration laws,” any “perceived deficienc[y] in the NLRA’s existing remedial arsenal” must be “addressed by congressional action,” not the courts.

**4. Backpay**: A remedy awarded by the NLRB to employees who have been unlawfully discharged or discriminated against for their union activity. Backpay is calculated based on the wages the employee would have earned had they not been discharged.

**5. Reinstatement**: A remedy awarded by the NLRB that requires an employer to rehire an employee who was unlawfully discharged or discriminated against.

**6. Undocumented Alien**: A person who is living in the United States without legal authorization.

**8. Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)**: A federal law that governs immigration to the United States, including the admission, naturalization, and deportation of aliens.

**9. Employer Verification System**: A system established by IRCA that requires employers to verify the identity and employment eligibility of all new hires through a process known as "I-9" verification.

**13.  "Punitive Remedy"**:  A remedy designed to punish an employer for their illegal conduct, rather than simply compensating the injured employee.

**14.  "Traditional Remedies"**:  The Board's usual remedies, such as cease and desist orders and posting notices, that don't involve financial compensation for the employee.

**15.  "Mitigation" of Damages**: The effort an employee is expected to make to reduce the amount of their lost wages by seeking new employment.

**16.  "Deference"**:  The court's practice of giving weight to the NLRB's interpretation of the NLRA, recognizing its expertise in labor law matters.

**18.  "Borderline Cases"**: Cases that involve situations where it is difficult to determine whether an employer knowingly hired an undocumented worker.

**19.  "Substandard Conditions"**: Working conditions that violate labor laws or are unsafe, unhealthy, or otherwise harmful to employees.
